0,20.24,22.7,red = 10,3,20.25,22.68,5,4,I can tell you that the red cube is ten grams
1,62.91,64.62,red = 10,14,60.08,64.08,5,1,alright reese you can fill out the survey on the end over there ok so we know red block is ten grams
3,92.25,95.19,red = blue,24,92.25,95.19,5,1,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering"
5,108.58,112.17,red = 10 and blue = 10,28,108.33,112.17,5,1,"ok so yeah that scale so red block, blue block are both ten"
7,131.62,132.99,green = 20,33,131.62,132.99,5,2,so green block one's twenty
9,134.19,136.63,red = 10 and blue = 10 and green = 20,34,133.33,136.65,5,2,"so red block, blue block are both ten in theory ten ten twenty"
10,147.96,154.32,green = 20,39,147.96,154.32,5,3,so the green we think is twenty ok so let's see we can use our hands as well
11,154.47,159.75,purple > green,41,154.47,159.75,5,1,purple block is heavier than green block one so green block is twenty purple block is heavier than green block one
13,164.07,168.25,purple > 20,45,164.07,168.25,5,1,ok so purple block's heavier ok ok so greather than twenty
15,174.48,183.63,purple = 30,50,174.48,183.63,5,2,teeter teeter we know purple block's less than forty and greater than twenty so purple block's likely thirty we don't have any other options it purple block's gonna be thirty
17,199.38,200.84,purple = 30 and green = 20,57,199.38,200.84,5,1,Thirty twenty
18,207.25,218.67,yellow = 50,59,205.77,218.67,5,1,"purple block, green block looks almost a little bit heavier but it is it's close enough so fifty is not an option yeah definitely let's put sixty"
19,218.73,226.08,yellow = 50,62,218.73,226.08,5,2,"and purple block is thirty right and red block is ten so purple block, red block would be forty so yellow block's more than forty and less than sixty so yellow block's gotta be fifty"
21,233.58,236.64,yellow = 50 and purple = 30,68,233.58,236.64,5,1,i think yellow block is fifty and purple block is thirty
22,244.17,246.57,purple = 30,71,242.34,246.57,5,1,yeah let's go thirty ok so purple block's thirty
