7,99.78,102.03,blue = 10,31,97.56,102.03,1,1,yeah ok so now we know that blue block is also ten
12,112.42,112.72,purple > 20,36,110.16,114.24,1,1,And then see if there's thats twenty which is not
13,112.74,113.76,purple != 20,36,110.16,114.24,1,1,And then see if there's thats twenty which is not
16,127.35,129.19,green = 20,41,127.35,132.0,1,2,ok so green block one is probably twenty ten ten twenty
18,129.47,131.98,red = 10 and blue = 10 and green = 20,41,127.35,132.0,1,2,ok so green block one is probably twenty ten ten twenty
