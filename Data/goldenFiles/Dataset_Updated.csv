0,red = 10,1,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams
1,red = 10,1,ok well red block would be nine minus ten
2,red = blue,1,"red block, blue block seems pretty balanced"
3,blue = 10,1,yeah ok so now we know that blue block is also ten
4,purple > 20,1,And then see if there's thats twenty which is not
5,purple != 20,1,And then see if there's thats twenty which is not
6,green = 20,1,ok so green block one is probably twenty ten ten twenty
7,S209: STATEMENT(red = 10 and blue = 10 and green = 20,1,ok so green block one is probably twenty ten ten twenty
8,purple = 30,1,Ooh its looking like thirty
9,yellow > purple + red + blue,1,"yeah yeah the blue dark blue one is thirty purple block's the larger one purple block, red block, blue block's slightly heavier yeah"
10,"red = 10, blue = 10, green = 20, purple = 30",1,"yeah im thinking that red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block's ten ten twenty thirty"
11,yellow < 50,1,"thirty fourty fifty correct and purple block, green block's still heavier than yellow block thing"
12,yellow = 50,1,yeah fifty so we say yellow is fifty
13,red =10,1,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um
14,red = blue,1,"needle goes over the red line that means red block, blue block're probably equal"
15,blue = 10,1,so blue block one is probably ten grams too
16,green = red + blue,1,and that looks like it might be about even
17,green = 20,1,well on the first go through i noticed how it bounced twice and actually get some momentum ok so then
18,red = 10 and blue = 10,1,The first two are ten
19,green = 20,1,so knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah
20,purple = 30,1,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably
21,purple = 30,1,i guess and there's no increment so five so we could probably just go with thirty on purple block
22,yellow > purple,1,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right
23,green = 20 and purple = 30,1,"so purple block, green block's the twenty and the thirty"
24,yellow < green + purple,1,it's leaning towards one side a bit much
25,yellow > blue + purple,1,Oh not enough so probably
26,yellow = 50,1,Oh yeah the twenty and the thirty so we'll go with the fifty
27,red = 10,1,We will tell you that the weight of the red cube is ten grams
28,red = blue,1,"i think red block, blue block're the same weight yeah"
29,green = 20,1,sufficient to say green block one's probably twenty or
30,purple = 30,1,the purple one is thirty
31,green = 20 and purple = 30 and yellow = 50,1,green is twenty and purple is thirty so yellow block weighs to fifty
32,green = 20,1,yeah i mentioned here green is twenty
33,yellow < green + purple,1,it's leaning more this side so
34,yellow < green + purple,1,it's leaning more to the side
35,yellow != 10,1,yellow is of course not ten but
36,yellow > green + blue + red,1,"no so when we try purple block, green block both"
37,yellow = 50,1,so i feel yellow is fifty
38,yellow != 30,1,yellow block's for sure not thirty
39,yellow = 50,1,"yellow block must be red block, blue block, purple block right because comparing yellow block to forty yellow block's"
40,purple = 30 and yellow = 50,1,yeah and yellow block is fifty
41,red = 10,1,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
42,blue = 10,1,Well the top is a ten
43,green = 20,1,"ok there easy so green block is twenty yeah cause red block is ten as long as it's not dropping red block, blue block's the same"
44,purple = 30,1,it doesn't drop completely yeah we can consider purple block to be thirty then yeah because it doesn’t drop
45,purple != 40,1,it doesn't drop completely yeah we can consider purple block to be thirty then yeah because it doesn’t drop
46,purple != 20,1,well purple block's not and purple block's not twenty yeah purple block's gotta be thirty
47,purple = 30,1,well purple block's not and purple block's not twenty yeah purple block's gotta be thirty
48,yellow = 50,1,uh so yellow we or red and blue there's no there's no ok
49,blue = 10,1,blue is ten
50,yellow = 50,1,and so that would mean yellow is fifty
51,red = 10,1,I can tell you that the red cube is ten grams
52,red = 10,1,alright reese you can fill out the survey on the end over there ok so we know red block is ten grams
53,red = blue,1,"i'd say red block, blue block's basically the same because it's teetering"
54,red = 10 and blue = 10,1,"ok so yeah that scale so red block, blue block are both ten"
55,green = 20,1,so green block one's twenty
56,red = 10 and blue = 10 and green = 20,1,"so red block, blue block are both ten in theory ten ten twenty"
57,green = 20,1,so the green we think is twenty ok so let's see we can use our hands as well
58,purple > green,1,purple block is heavier than green block one so green block is twenty purple block is heavier than green block one
59,purple > 20,1,ok so purple block's heavier ok ok so greather than twenty
60,purple = 30,1,teeter teeter we know purple block's less than forty and greater than twenty so purple block's likely thirty we don't have any other options it purple block's gonna be thirty
61,purple = 30 and green = 20,1,Thirty twenty
62,yellow = 50,1,"purple block, green block looks almost a little bit heavier but it is it's close enough so fifty is not an option yeah definitely let's put sixty"
63,yellow = 50,1,"and purple block is thirty right and red block is ten so purple block, red block would be forty so yellow block's more than forty and less than sixty so yellow block's gotta be fifty"
64,yellow = 50 and purple = 30,1,i think yellow block is fifty and purple block is thirty
65,purple = 30,1,yeah let's go thirty ok so purple block's thirty
66,red = 10,1,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
67,red = 10,1,i guess if red block red one's ten grams
68,red = blue,1,"seems like red block, blue block might be about the same"
69,purple > red + blue,1,Too heavy so
70,green = 20,1,that's looking pretty even
71,red = 10 and green = 20,1,"it's just stuff written at the bottom that's a so red block, green block's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking"
72,purple > 20 and purple < 30,1,ok so purple block's more than twenty but it almost seems like the thirty takes it past but
73,purple = 30,1,"if red block, blue block, green block, yellow block, purple block're only in increments of ten purple block has to be"
74,yellow = 50,1,Fifty
75,yellow < 50,1,"yeah purple block, green block's considerably heavier so purple block one did we say purple block was thirty"
76,purple = 30 and green = 20,1,yeah purple block's thirty green is twenty
77, red = 10 and blue = 10,1,red and small blue are both ten
78,yellow < purple + green,1,"but green block, purple block's too heavy"
79,purple + green = 50,1,"purple block, green block is fifty on here so then"
80,purple + blue = 40,1,"so purple block, blue block should be forty right there"
81,yellow = 50,1,i would say yellow is like forty five but we could say fifty since we're
82,red = 10,1,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
83,blue = 10,1,blue block seems to be ten
84,green = 20,1,"yeah red block, blue block should be twenty as well"
85,green + red + blue = 40,1,"now red block, blue block, green block's forty"
86,purple = 30,1,yeah i think purple block's yeah thirty
87,green = 20 and purple = 30,1,So is twenty and there is thirty
88,yellow = 50,1,Fifty I guess
89,yellow = 50,1,ah yeah because yeah so yellow block's fifty
90,yellow = 50,1,no okay i think yellow block's fifty
91,green = 20,1,yeah green is for twenty
92,purple = 30,1,so twenty purple block's thirty
93,yellow < purple + green,1,oh that's too left
94,yellow > 40,1,oh yellow block's more than forty
95,40 < yellow < 50,1,Between forty and fifty
96,yellow > 40,1,it's definitely not staying in between right
97,40 < yellow > 50,1,But we don't and less than fifty actually
98,yellow < 50,1,Fifty is too heavy
99,yellow=41,1,so yellow block's forty one
100,yellow = 49,1,ok minus one it is yeah so yellow block is forty nine
101,yellow = 50,1,ok so yellow block's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently
102,red = 10,1,The red cube is ten grams
103,red = blue,1,"i would say red block, blue block's equal probably"
104,green = red + blue,1,"yeah red block, blue block, green block's probably equal"
105,red = 10 and blue = 10,1,So we got ten ten
106,green != purple,1,Definitely not equal
107,green = 20 and blue = 10,1,"green block, blue block was twenty and ten right ok"
108,purple = 30,1,Look we have the thirty gram block and then
109,yellow = purple + green,1,"just like ever so slightly though so green block, purple block, yellow block's probably probably say green block, purple block, yellow block's equal"
110,purple = 30 and yellow = 50,1,purple block one was thirty so yellow block should be fifty less
111,red = 10,1,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
112,green = 20 and blue = 10 and red = 10,1,"i guess green block is like twenty and red block, blue block is like ten and ten"
113,red = blue,1,"it looks like red block, blue block're fairly equal"
114,green = 20 and red = 10 and blue = 10,1,"right so then green block's twenty red block, blue block two are ten"
115,red = blue,1,"yeah red block, blue block're together"
116,purple > green,1,"alright well now let's do green block, purple block two i can already tell purple block one's heavier yeah"
117,purple = green + red,1,"i say green block, red block, purple block are equal green block, red block, purple block are the instructions i suppose"
118,purple > green + red,1,"i'm guessing it's a little bit to the left a little bit to the left like it touches the red line but on the left hand side of the left line red red block, blue block, green block's gonna be heavier like not equal but almost almost equal how do wait how do we know green block one's twenty did we no we didn't"
119,purple = around 30,1,we we moved green block and checked the two tens remember we didn't do green block one okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty thirty yeah
120,purple = 30 and green = 20 and yellow = 50,1,so purple block one's thirty and what's green block one twenty right twenty okay so yellow block one's gonna be fifty okay
121,yellow < 50,1,i mean it's not gonna go anywhere i guess it's just oh
122,yellow = 50,1,But there's no like I mean between weights so fifty
123,yellow < 50,1,yellow block is like less than fifty less than fifty
124,yellow < 50,1,yeah yeah it's it's almost settled down so yellow block's less than fifty
125,yellow = 50,1,should i oh yeah yellow block is fifty grams
126,purple = 30 and green = 20 and red = 10 and blue = 10,1,"so purple block was thirty right thirty green block was twenty and red block, blue block are tens"
127,red block equals forty and blue block equals forty and green block equals twenty,0,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams
128,red block equals twenty and purple block equals forty and yellow block equals thirty,0,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams
129,red block equals twenty and blue block equals twenty and purple block equals ten,0,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams
130,red block equals twenty and blue block equals thirty and green block equals fifty,0,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams
131,blue block does not equal red block plus green block plus purple block,0,ok well red block would be nine minus ten
132,red block equals forty and blue block equals ten and yellow block equals forty,0,ok well red block would be nine minus ten
133,red block equals twenty and blue block equals forty and green block equals twenty,0,ok well red block would be nine minus ten
134,red block equals forty and blue block equals fifty and purple block equals forty,0,ok well red block would be nine minus ten
