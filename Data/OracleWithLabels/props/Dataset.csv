0,red =10,1,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um
1,red = blue,1,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal
2,blue = 10,1,Yeah
3,green = red + blue,1,And that looks like it might be about even
4,green = 20,1,Yeah so that's probably twenty grams
5,red = 10 and blue = 10,1,The first two are ten
6,green = 20,1,So knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah
7,purple = 30,1,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably
8,purple = 30,1,Yeah yeah closest like
9,yellow > purple,1,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right
10,green = 20 and purple = 30,1,So that's the twenty and the thirty
11,yellow < green + purple,1,It's leaning towards one side a bit much
12,yellow > blue + purple,1,Ok
13,yellow = 50,1,Yeah and the thirty so fifty
14,red = 10,1,We will tell you that the weight of the red cube is ten grams
15,red = blue,1,I think they are same weight
16,green = 20,1,Sufficient to say that one's probably twenty or
17,purple = 30,1,The purple one is thirty
18,green = 20 and purple = 30 and yellow = 50,1,Green is twenty and purple is thirty so it weighs to fifty
19,green = 20,1,It's leaning more this side so
20,yellow < green + purple,1,It's leaning more this side so
21,yellow < green + purple,1,It's leaning more to the side
22,yellow != 10,1,Yellow is of course not ten but
23,yellow > green + blue + red,1,No so when we try these both 
24,yellow = 50,1,That is equivalent to the 
25,yellow != 30,1,It's for sure not thirty
26,yellow = 50,1,Fifty  
27,purple = 30 and yellow = 50,1,Thirty and yellow is fifty
28,red = 10,1,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
29,blue = 10,1,Well the top is a ten
30,green = 20,1,Is it ten and this was equal to this one
31,purple = 30,1,Can we yeah and it's obviously not forty
32,purple != 40,1,Can we yeah and it's obviously not forty
33,purple != 20,1,Well it's not and it's not twenty yeah it's gotta be thirty
34,purple = 30,1,Well it's not and it's not twenty yeah it's gotta be thirty
35,yellow = 50,1,Ok so we can say that this is fifty
36,blue = 10,1,Sixty right 
37,yellow = 50,1,And so that would mean yellow is fifty
38,red = 10,1,I can tell you that the red cube is ten grams
39,red = 10,1,So we know this is ten
40,red = blue,1,I'd say that's basically the same because it's teetering
41,red = 10 and blue = 10,1,So these are both ten   
42,green = 20,1,So that one's twenty
43,red = 10 and blue = 10 and green = 20,1,So these are both ten in theory ten ten twenty
44,green = 20,1,The green is twenty
45,purple > green,1,Which one is heavier
46,purple > 20,1,So we have twenty
47,purple = 30,1,What if I do this ok so less than forty likely thirty ok
48,purple = 30 and green = 20,1,Plus twenty
49,yellow = 50,1,Yeah I'd make it a five if we had a five option 
50,yellow = 50,1,Yellow fifty
51,yellow = 50 and purple = 30,1,I think that's fifty
52,purple = 30,1,And that one's thirty thirty
53,red = 10,1,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
54,red = 10,1,We got red ten
55,red = blue,1,Seems like it might be about the same
56,purple > red + blue,1,Too heavy so
57,green = 20,1,That's looking pretty even
58,red = 10 and green = 20,1,It's just different at the bottom that's a so that's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking
59,purple > 20 and purple < 30,1,Ok so it's more than twenty but it almost seems like the thirty takes it past but
60,purple = 30,1,I think it could also be the position
61,yellow = 50,1,Fifty
62,yellow < 50,1,Yeah that's considerably heavier so this one did we say this was thirty
63,purple = 30 and green = 20,1,Yeah that's thirty green is twenty
64, red = 10 and blue = 10,1,Red and small blue are both ten
65,yellow < purple + green,1,But it's too heavy
66,purple + green = 50,1,Yeah green and big blue
67,purple + blue = 40,1,Big blue was forty
68,yellow = 50,1,I would say that it is at least closest to fifty
69,red = 10,1,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here
70,blue = 10,1,It seems to be ten
71,green = 20,1,Okay
72,green + red + blue = 40,1,This is
73,purple = 30,1,Yup
74,green = 20 and purple = 30,1,so is twenty plus
75,yellow = 50,1,Yeah I think fifty seems right
76,yellow = 50,1,So now we've kind of destructed everything
77,yellow = 50,1,That is correct
78,yellow = 50 and purple = 30 and blue = 10,1,Without using
79,green = 20,1,Yeah green is for twenty
80,purple = 30,1,So twenty that's thirty
81,yellow < purple + green,1,Oh that's too left
82,yellow > 40,1,Oh it's more than forty
83,40 < yellow < 50,1,Between forty and fifty
84,yellow > 40,1,Yeah it's more than forty
85,40 < yellow > 50,1,But we don't and less than fifty actually
86,yellow < 50,1,Fifty is too heavy
87,yellow=41,1,So it's forty one
88,yellow = 49,1,Minus one forty nine
89,yellow = 50,1,Ok so it's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently
90,red = 10,1,The red cube is ten grams
91,red = blue,1,I would say that's equal probably
92,green = red + blue,1,Yeah it's probably equal
93,red = 10 and blue = 10,1,So we got ten ten
94,green != purple,1,Definitely not equal
95,green = 20 and blue = 10,1,That was twenty ten yep
96,purple = 30,1,I think yep
97,yellow = purple + green,1,I think it's sixty so this one was twenty
98,purple = 30 and yellow = 50,1,This one was thirty so this should be fifty less
99,red = 10,1,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams.
100,green = 20 and blue = 10 and red = 10,1,I guess this is like twenty and this is like ten and ten.
101,red = blue,1,It looks like they're fairly equal.
102,green = 20 and red = 10 and blue = 10,1,Right so then that's twenty these two are ten.
103,red = blue,1,Yeah they're together.
104,purple > green,1,I can already tell this one's heavier yeah.
105,purple = green + red,1,Those are the instructions I suppose
106,purple > green + red,1,no we didn't
107,purple = around 30,1,Thirty yeah
108,purple = 30 and green = 20 and yellow = 50,1,Twenty okay so this one's gonna be fifty okay.
109,yellow < 50,1,Oh.
110,yellow = 50,1,But there's no like I mean between weights so fifty.
111,yellow < 50,1,This is like less than fifty less than fifty.
112,yellow < 50,1,Yeah yeah it's it's almost settled down so it's less than fifty
113,yellow = 50,1,Oh yeah this is fifty grams 
114,purple = 30 and green = 20 and red = 10 and blue = 10,1,Thirty this was twenty and these are tens
115,red block equals ten and green block equals forty and yellow block equals twenty,0,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um
