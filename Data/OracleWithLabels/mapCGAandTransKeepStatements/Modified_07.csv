0,30.9,34.59,red = 10,6,34.59,37.83,7,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here
1,107.29,110.3,blue = 10,21,107.31,109.09,7,2,It seems to be ten
3,139.87,145.93,green = 20,35,145.93,146.25,7,3,Okay
5,152.57,155.75,green + red + blue = 40,42,155.75,156.25,7,1,This is
6,179.32,184.42,purple = 30,50,184.42,184.62,7,3,Yup
7,192.91,202.58,green = 20 and purple = 30,54,202.58,204.82,7,2,so is twenty plus
8,212.92,226.5,yellow = 50,61,226.5,228.62,7,3,Yeah I think fifty seems right
11,394.04,397.36,yellow = 50,134,396.5,399.0,7,2,So now we've kind of destructed everything
14,457.21,470.13,yellow = 50,159,470.13,470.92,7,2,That is correct
15,470.13,523.66,yellow = 50 and purple = 30 and blue = 10,175,523.66,524.75,7,2,Without using
