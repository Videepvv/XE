15,141.91,142.91,purple = green + red,52,140.64,142.91,10,1,Those are the instructions I suppose
17,201.56,202.56,purple > green + red,75,202.32,202.56,10,2,no we didn't
18,216.0,217.0,purple = around 30,82,216.15,216.41,10,2,Thirty yeah
20,253.24,254.24,purple = 30 and green = 20 and yellow = 50,93,251.78,254.24,10,2,Twenty okay so this one's gonna be fifty okay.
21,268.13,269.13,yellow < 50,97,268.15,268.91,10,3,Oh.
23,273.0,274.0,yellow = 50,99,270.0,274.0,10,2,But there's no like I mean between weights so fifty.
25,285.57,286.57,yellow < 50,104,283.84,286.57,10,2,This is like less than fifty less than fifty.
27,304.0,305.0,yellow < 50,113,303.0,305.0,10,2,Yeah yeah it's it's almost settled down so it's less than fifty
28,306.26,307.26,yellow = 50,114,305.08,307.26,10,3,Oh yeah this is fifty grams 
29,311.48,312.48,purple = 30 and green = 20 and red = 10 and blue = 10,117,309.31,312.48,10,1,Thirty this was twenty and these are tens
