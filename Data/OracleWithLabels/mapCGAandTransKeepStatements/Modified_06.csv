0,21.12,24.51,red = 10,3,21.12,24.51,6,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
1,63.42,66.0,red = 10,10,63.42,66.0,6,2,We got red ten
2,72.45,76.17,red = blue,12,72.45,76.17,6,1,Seems like it might be about the same
5,89.76,91.06,purple > red + blue,15,89.76,91.06,6,3,Too heavy so
6,102.35,104.28,green = 20,20,102.3,103.5,6,1,That's looking pretty even
8,116.79,125.37,red = 10 and green = 20,26,116.79,125.37,6,2,It's just different at the bottom that's a so that's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking
10,141.18,146.85,purple > 20 and purple < 30,34,141.18,146.85,6,2,Ok so it's more than twenty but it almost seems like the thirty takes it past but
11,156.33,161.08,purple = 30,38,160.58,162.57,6,3,I think it could also be the position
14,177.57,178.08,yellow = 50,44,177.57,178.08,6,2,Fifty
16,186.24,190.92,yellow < 50,47,186.24,190.92,6,3,Yeah that's considerably heavier so this one did we say this was thirty
17,192.61,195.21,purple = 30 and green = 20,49,192.61,195.21,6,2,Yeah that's thirty green is twenty
18,195.24,196.42, red = 10 and blue = 10,50,195.24,196.42,6,2,Red and small blue are both ten
19,201.21,202.25,yellow < purple + green,52,201.21,202.25,6,3,But it's too heavy
20,205.44,209.58,purple + green = 50,56,208.84,211.5,6,2,Yeah green and big blue
22,224.5,226.56,purple + blue = 40,61,223.5,226.56,6,1,Big blue was forty
23,237.36,240.75,yellow = 50,63,237.36,240.75,6,1,I would say that it is at least closest to fifty
