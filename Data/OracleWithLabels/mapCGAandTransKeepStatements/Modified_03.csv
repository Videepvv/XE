0,33.39,38.04,red = 10,2,33.39,38.04,3,4,We will tell you that the weight of the red cube is ten grams
3,142.38,145.07,red = blue,24,142.38,145.07,3,2,I think they are same weight
7,212.13,214.16,green = 20,42,212.13,214.16,3,1,Sufficient to say that one's probably twenty or
10,238.47,240.45,purple = 30,48,238.47,240.45,3,2,The purple one is thirty
13,269.35,272.58,green = 20 and purple = 30 and yellow = 50,58,269.35,272.58,3,3,Green is twenty and purple is thirty so it weighs to fifty
15,277.53,279.75,green = 20,61,277.92,281.43,3,2,It's leaning more this side so
16,279.77,281.42,yellow < green + purple,61,277.92,281.43,3,2,It's leaning more this side so
17,285.18,287.82,yellow < green + purple,62,285.18,287.82,3,2,It's leaning more to the side
21,314.1,315.58,yellow != 10,69,314.1,315.58,3,3,Yellow is of course not ten but
23,336.06,338.42,yellow > green + blue + red,77,337.33,341.55,3,3,No so when we try these both 
24,344.01,348.36,yellow = 50,79,345.75,347.42,3,1,That is equivalent to the 
27,366.06,371.16,yellow != 30,83,366.06,371.16,3,2,It's for sure not thirty
28,399.16,402.03,yellow = 50,88,400.01,400.5,3,2,Fifty  
29,431.58,435.75,purple = 30 and yellow = 50,97,431.58,435.75,3,2,Thirty and yellow is fifty
