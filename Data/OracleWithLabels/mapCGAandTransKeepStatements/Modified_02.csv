0,23.52,26.76,red =10,5,23.52,32.73,2,4,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um
1,88.98,91.58,red = blue,20,88.98,91.58,2,1,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal
2,104.08,106.23,blue = 10,26,102.45,104.75,2,2,Yeah
4,124.68,127.02,green = red + blue,33,124.68,127.02,2,2,And that looks like it might be about even
5,144.92,149.08,green = 20,38,144.92,149.08,2,1,Yeah so that's probably twenty grams
7,152.31,153.75,red = 10 and blue = 10,40,152.31,153.75,2,1,The first two are ten
9,158.13,164.17,green = 20,43,158.13,164.17,2,2,So knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah
12,192.69,195.87,purple = 30,52,192.69,195.87,2,1,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably
14,221.4,225.41,purple = 30,58,222.5,227.46,2,1,Yeah yeah closest like
17,237.51,241.77,yellow > purple,62,237.51,241.77,2,1,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right
18,247.95,250.17,green = 20 and purple = 30,64,247.95,250.17,2,2,So that's the twenty and the thirty
19,255.36,258.01,yellow < green + purple,65,255.36,258.01,2,2,It's leaning towards one side a bit much
21,264.3,268.65,yellow > blue + purple,69,266.91,267.33,2,2,Ok
22,271.92,275.16,yellow = 50,72,272.5,274.25,2,1,Yeah and the thirty so fifty
