0,20.24,22.7,red = 10,3,20.25,22.68,5,4,I can tell you that the red cube is ten grams
1,62.91,64.62,red = 10,15,62.91,64.62,5,2,So we know this is ten
3,92.25,95.19,red = blue,24,92.25,95.19,5,1,I'd say that's basically the same because it's teetering
5,108.58,112.17,red = 10 and blue = 10,29,108.58,112.17,5,2,So these are both ten   
7,131.62,132.99,green = 20,34,131.62,132.99,5,2,So that one's twenty
9,134.19,136.63,red = 10 and blue = 10 and green = 20,35,133.33,136.65,5,2,So these are both ten in theory ten ten twenty
10,147.96,154.32,green = 20,41,149.68,151.01,5,2,The green is twenty
11,154.47,159.75,purple > green,43,156.5,157.58,5,2,Which one is heavier
13,164.07,168.25,purple > 20,47,167.06,170.07,5,3,So we have twenty
15,174.48,183.63,purple = 30,52,175.5,181.24,5,1,What if I do this ok so less than forty likely thirty ok
17,199.38,200.84,purple = 30 and green = 20,59,200.25,201.26,5,2,Plus twenty
18,207.25,218.67,yellow = 50,63,207.34,211.67,5,3,Yeah I'd make it a five if we had a five option 
19,218.73,226.08,yellow = 50,66,225.75,226.67,5,3,Yellow fifty
21,233.58,236.64,yellow = 50 and purple = 30,71,235.08,235.92,5,2,I think that's fifty
22,244.17,246.57,purple = 30,74,244.17,246.57,5,2,And that one's thirty thirty
