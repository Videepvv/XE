2,10.09,11.43,green = 20,2,8.07,11.55,8,2,Yeah green is for twenty
7,33.94,35.65,purple = 30,10,32.52,35.67,8,2,So twenty that's thirty
12,74.08,76.06,yellow < purple + green,24,74.07,76.05,8,1,Oh that's too left
16,133.433,134.777,yellow > 40,42,132.0,134.91,8,1,Oh it's more than forty
18,144.78,146.77,40 < yellow < 50,45,144.78,146.76,8,1,Between forty and fifty
19,157.58,159.33,yellow > 40,47,157.58,159.33,8,1,Yeah it's more than forty
22,168.19,170.67,40 < yellow > 50,54,168.21,170.67,8,1,But we don't and less than fifty actually
25,194.45,196.62,yellow < 50,63,194.46,196.62,8,1,Fifty is too heavy
30,237.91,240.34,yellow=41,80,237.93,239.33,8,1,So it's forty one
34,276.176,277.705,yellow = 49,92,275.25,276.5,8,2,Minus one forty nine
36,280.19,284.04,yellow = 50,93,280.2,284.04,8,3,Ok so it's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently
