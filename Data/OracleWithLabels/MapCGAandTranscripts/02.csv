23.52,26.76,S0: STATEMENT(red =10) ,5,23.52,32.73,2,4,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um
88.98,91.58,S1: STATEMENT(red = blue),20,88.98,91.58,2,1,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal
104.08,106.23,S2: STATEMENT(blue = 10),26,102.45,104.75,2,2,Yeah
119.13,120.16,R1: RECOMMENDATION(green = ?),30,119.13,120.16,2,1,We can do like the
124.68,127.02,S4: STATEMENT(green = red + blue),33,124.68,127.02,2,2,And that looks like it might be about even
144.92,149.08,S5: STATEMENT(green = 20),38,144.92,149.08,2,1,Yeah so that's probably twenty grams
149.97,151.95,ACCEPT(S4),39,149.97,151.95,2,1,You'd imagine and then
152.31,153.75,S6: STATEMENT(red = 10 and blue = 10),40,152.31,153.75,2,1,The first two are ten
154.58,155.34,ACCEPT(S6),41,154.58,155.34,2,2,Yep
158.13,164.17,S7: STATEMENT(green = 20),43,158.13,164.17,2,2,So knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah
165.56,166.59,ACCEPT(S7),45,165.56,166.59,2,3,Yeah
167.11,169.1,R2: RECOMMENDATION(purple = ?),46,167.13,169.11,2,3,This is what we are looking at next
192.69,195.87,S8: STATEMENT(purple = 30),52,192.69,195.87,2,1,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably
195.93,199.5,DOUBT(S8),53,195.93,199.5,2,2,Yeah but it still feels like it's leaning towards the two blocks
221.4,225.41,S9: STATEMENT(purple = 30),58,222.5,227.46,2,1,Yeah yeah closest like
225.43,227.47,ACCEPT(S9),58,222.5,227.46,2,1,Yeah yeah closest like
233.61,236.49,R3: RECOMMENDATION(yellow = ?),61,233.61,236.49,2,1,Putting this on that side checking this one
237.51,241.77,S10: STATEMENT(yellow > purple),62,237.51,241.77,2,1,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right
247.95,250.17,S12: STATEMENT(green = 20 and purple = 30),64,247.95,250.17,2,2,So that's the twenty and the thirty
255.36,258.01,S13: STATEMENT(yellow < green + purple),65,255.36,258.01,2,2,It's leaning towards one side a bit much
258.08,260.67,ACCEPT(S13),66,258.08,260.67,2,1,Yeah we could probably try it with just ten
264.3,268.65,S14: STATEMENT(yellow > blue + purple),69,266.91,267.33,2,2,Ok
271.92,275.16,S14: STATEMENT(yellow = 50),72,272.5,274.25,2,1,Yeah and the thirty so fifty
