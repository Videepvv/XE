0,11.82,27.57,3,4,Ok so the test that you are going to be completing today oh I can take those consent forms sorry thank you the test you are going to be completing today is the weights test
1,28.2,32.67,3,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these blocks
2,33.39,38.04,3,4,We will tell you that the weight of the red cube is ten grams
3,38.76,42.57,3,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using this scale
4,43.68,46.5,3,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams
5,46.86,50.43,3,4,You don't need to use the slider or anything 
6,51,58.38,3,4,And the the weights aren't always perfect so like if it's teetering it's probably fine
7,58.44,60.57,3,4,Like it it drops one's probably heavier
8,61.35,64.23,3,4,Um and then
9,64.26,75.69,3,4,You will place the cubes on the worksheet where you think they are and you will also record your answers here on this survey here on the computer. You guys will be group three
10,77.91,80.37,3,4,And you can now start the survey
11,80.55,86.25,3,1,Alright so shall we
12,86.43,87.67,3,1,Prepare things for this one
13,88.25,89.4,3,3,Yeah
14,90.33,92.46,3,0,
15,95.52,99.06,3,0,
16,101.37,103.74,3,0,
17,112.41,114.39,3,1,So you think they're the same weight or
18,116.13,118.17,3,1,They're still teetering
19,119.37,121.53,3,0,
20,129.21,134.16,3,0,
21,135.15,137.13,3,0,
22,138.33,140.46,3,0,
23,144.5,147.27,3,1,I think they're the same weight yeah
24,142.38,145.07,3,2,I think they are same weight
25,148.62,150.2,3,1,So
26,148.62,149.75,3,3,So  
27,149.24,150.25,3,1,So the 
28,151.25,152.4,3,2,Right here right
29,152.43,155.22,3,3,Um  
30,155.67,157.95,3,0,
31,160.57,162,3,3,So 
32,159.15,160.56,3,1,So
33,162.4,165.36,3,3,The blue one is also ten right
34,165.45,167.82,3,3,So I should indicate it as ten
35,165.45,165.67,3,1,Right  
36,168.99,171.72,3,1,Um I'm going to see if there's a lighter one
37,179.07,181.11,3,0,
38,183.78,185.76,3,0,
39,186.96,192.42,3,1,The suspense is killing me it takes forever
40,207.42,209.4,3,0,
41,214.42,219.93,3,3,Yes it's probably twenty so green one is twenty
42,212.13,214.16,3,1,Sufficient to say that one's probably twenty or
43,219.96,226.53,3,2,Then well uh no uh I want to check if N A block is thirty so
44,219.91,224.42,3,1,What do you want
45,227.61,229.92,3,0,
46,232.32,235.65,3,1,I think that's a good guess
47,236.34,238.32,3,2,So
48,238.47,240.45,3,2,The purple one is thirty
49,241.8,243.42,3,3,Purple is thirty yeah 
50,243.66,246,3,2,Which is the one which is purple
51,246.36,247.42,3,2,Hold that purple
52,246.36,250.86,3,1,I think this is more purple-y yeah
53,248.5,250.25,3,3,This is blue maybe 
54,251.49,253.47,3,1,Um
55,254.04,264.18,3,1,This one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try that one
56,264.21,266.16,3,3,Green is twenty right
57,265.65,268.29,3,2,Green and this one
58,269.35,272.58,3,3,Green is twenty and purple is thirty so it weighs to fifty
59,274.95,277.05,3,1,It seems to be
60,277.53,279.75,3,2,Yeah I mentioned here green is twenty
61,277.92,281.43,3,2,It's leaning more this side so
62,285.18,287.82,3,2,It's leaning more to the side
63,288.93,294.3,3,3,So how about yellow
64,298.35,300.96,3,2,Then green is twenty and they weigh
65,295.29,298,3,3,Uh put both on top please
66,302.91,305.34,3,3,Yeah just to confirm
67,305.46,309.58,3,1,Wait purple is how much purple was thirty
68,309.08,310.8,3,3,Purple is thirty
69,314.1,315.58,3,3,Yellow is of course not ten but
70,316.41,317.43,3,1,And green is 
71,318.6,320.58,3,1,Twenty
72,322.83,324.81,3,0,
73,326.85,330.69,3,1,Have we tried these two and the green one cause it's
74,331.05,333.57,3,1,Kinda dipping
75,333.69,335.82,3,0,
76,336.06,338.42,3,1,Nope that's too light ok too light
77,337.33,341.55,3,3,No so when we try these both 
78,344.01,348.36,3,3,So I feel yellow is fifty
79,345.75,347.42,3,1,That is equivalent to the 
80,348.96,352.41,3,0,
81,356.19,359.46,3,3,This has thirty and twenty
82,359.91,362.94,3,3,Yeah green is twenty and purple is thirty
83,366.06,371.16,3,2,It's for sure not thirty
84,371.49,378.24,3,1,So if you put the purple and just to verify that all of our weights are correct
85,378.27,380.25,3,1,Uh
86,396.69,404.73,3,1,It must be this right because comparing it to forty it's
87,399.16,402.03,3,3,Fifty yeah
88,400.01,400.5,3,2,Fifty  
89,405.48,407.64,3,1,Not that heavy
90,408.93,411.03,3,1,So are we done
91,413.94,415.92,3,1,Try it
92,416.34,418.5,3,0,
93,418.92,422.85,3,0,
94,423.09,426.93,3,0,
95,427.92,430.44,3,3,Twenty green yeah
96,432.25,433.84,3,3,Yeah and this is fifty
97,431.58,435.75,3,2,Thirty and yellow is fifty
98,435.78,440.73,3,2,Maybe we should try those things here
99,435.78,447.87,3,3,Just place the color on top
100,444.78,445.75,3,1,Try what then
101,450.33,451.5,3,4,And have you guys filled out the survey
102,451.65,452,3,2,Yes
103,452.33,453.93,3,3,Yeah until fifty
104,461.81,466.8,3,3,Uh just till fifty so should I sumbit it
105,459.84,461.08,3,4,Um did you submit the answer
106,469.65,473.16,3,3,Correct red is ten blue is ten
107,479.75,489.87,3,4,Ok so for the next part if the test you are going to determine the weight of this block without using the scale to get the answer
108,473.7,477.58,3,3,Green is twenty purple is thirty and yellow is fifty yeah good
109,485.58,486.66,3,1,Oh fun
110,490.23,492.21,3,4,And you can begin now
111,497.58,500.34,3,1,Think it's a little heavier than the yellow
112,501.12,503.1,3,0,
113,505.05,507.09,3,0,
114,507.54,509.85,3,0,
115,510.21,512.28,3,0,
116,518.79,522.48,3,1,Is there a way for us to test it other than just our
117,522.84,524.82,3,1,Perception
118,532.53,536.73,3,3,I think this is a bit more heavier and
119,537.54,539.52,3,3,So
120,541.83,547.11,3,3,Maybe ninety or a hundred
121,548.37,559.95,3,1,I bet there's a scale app on our phone and I bet it's cheating to download that
122,553,553.82,3,4,It's cheating
123,558.69,560.67,3,0,
124,567.39,569.61,3,2,Yeah it could be eighty ninety
125,570.91,574.89,3,3,I think it is between ninety to a hundred
126,569.88,570.75,3,2,Eighty to ninety
127,576.3,581.25,3,3,Because yeah green is twenty thirty and fifty right so
128,581.31,583.86,3,3,Maybe a hundred or so
129,584.76,586.74,3,0,
130,587.04,590.67,3,1,Is it twice as heavy as the yellow one I can't tell
131,589.42,590.67,3,2,No it's not 
132,591.45,596.94,3,1,Are the wait which one was the fifty one it was the it was yellow ok
133,594.17,596.94,3,3,Fifty is yellow yeah
134,599.13,601.83,3,2,It's not twice as heavy as yellow
135,609.12,612.06,3,2,I think it's between eighty and ninety
136,612.33,614.4,3,0,
137,616.05,621,3,1,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown like
138,621.09,631.11,3,1,and your eyes and just kind of like hold them really flat and close your eyes for a second and tell me when the yellow tell me when this hand feels the same as the other
139,632.55,634.83,3,3,This is heavier I can
140,635.58,638.4,3,1,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same
141,643.5,645.41,3,1,Still lighter
142,643.66,648.78,3,3,I think yeah it does
143,648.96,652.58,3,1,I was trying to take the the visual input out of it
144,651.25,654,3,3,I think it is ok now
145,654.33,656.16,3,1,You think that's about the same
146,654.18,654.35,3,3,Yeah
147,657.24,664.5,3,3,Yeah I feel that can you even try that because yeah
148,660.83,664.5,3,1,Yeah yeah try it try it again
149,669.27,671.25,3,3,How do you feel this one is lighter
150,674.82,677.82,3,1,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but
151,678.12,683.79,3,1,Like the right my right I feel like that one could be a smidge heavier but
152,683.94,685.92,3,1,I don't know hang on
153,689.1,691.08,3,3,I'll just check now
154,692.01,693.99,3,1,Now I feel like the right side
155,694.62,696.6,3,1,Definitely heavier right
156,697.47,708.48,3,1,It's hard to tell it's hard to tell they're really close they're really close yeah give it a shot ok so here's our heavy one
157,700.75,745.01,3,3,It's it's your turn you have to try now you have to try
158,708.99,710.97,3,2,Ok
159,713.04,720.99,3,2,I think this is heavier now I was thinking like if you have
160,714.42,715.42,3,3,Oh my god   
161,717.08,718.17,3,1,Definitely not
162,721.26,726.18,3,2,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster
163,727.29,730.17,3,2,It's the same
164,731.37,734.1,3,3,But where do we get that now
165,734.13,737.67,3,0,
166,738.66,741.42,3,3,Does this really heavier than this for sure
167,737.88,742.59,3,1,I think we would have to have really good measures yeah yeah
168,743.58,745.77,3,0,
169,749.43,751.41,3,0,
170,755.07,757.98,3,3,Can get that one
171,758.43,760.89,3,0,
172,771.17,777.81,3,1,I feel like there's gotta be a clever way like an answer I don't know what it is
173,769.05,772.84,3,3,Ok I think it would be ninety or something
174,779.52,781.5,3,0,
175,784.86,786.84,3,0,
176,786.87,790.86,3,2,Now I think it might be hundred but
177,792.92,801.9,3,3,Yeah in between ninety and hundred but when we see normally when we compare those both but it is not showing that it is exactly double or something
178,791.37,791.92,3,2,Maybe ninety to 
179,803.08,805.44,3,1,Can I see your phone actually
180,802.41,802.83,3,2,Yeah it's not double 
181,809.31,813.42,3,3,Wow
182,817.66,824.16,3,2,I think we had place on our block here so it won't fall directly
183,816.92,820.25,3,3,Oops put both at a time maybe
184,825.63,827.61,3,0,
185,828.33,830.31,3,3,I'll remember that red one
186,831.78,840.21,3,1,I feel like that's close enough that's close enough right
187,831.78,839.66,3,3,It's yeah that's really a bit tiny yeah
188,840.24,844.83,3,3,Just once remove this block
189,846.08,849.39,3,1,So it's still pretty even it's still pretty even
190,849.9,854.52,3,3,Purple is thirty even we are getting that
191,852.42,853.84,3,2,Seventy it's just seventy
192,854.73,857.82,3,0,
193,858.03,861.99,3,3,Oops
194,862.2,864.63,3,1,We just got it balanced too well I think
195,868.83,870.81,3,0,
196,872.37,875.07,3,0,
197,877.14,879.12,3,0,
198,880.71,882.69,3,0,
199,882.9,886.74,3,1,Yeah it's pretty far to this side right now
200,887.49,890.91,3,1,Fourth try
201,891.08,892.92,3,3,We'll do one thing
202,894.51,899.1,3,0,
203,899.19,901.35,3,1,Oh yeah
204,905.97,908.19,3,0,
205,909.54,911.58,3,0,
206,914.7,915.42,3,1,It's leaning that side 
207,915.91,919.11,3,3,Yeah it's leaning that way ok let me put this
208,919.56,921.6,3,0,
209,921.63,923.91,3,2,It's eighty
210,924.9,926.88,3,0,
211,927.15,930.33,3,3,It's leaning still leaning that side just remove one
212,934.02,939.54,3,1,What ok so this one's fifty and thirty
213,936.58,938.08,3,3,Fifty and thirty
214,940.17,943.35,3,2,If you have like if you keep twenty
215,945.12,949.77,3,2,It should it does still leaning
216,952.8,954.84,3,0,
217,961.32,965.31,3,3,I'm thinking to just remove this once
218,965.79,971.49,3,3,So now it's leaning this way if we put that it's leaning this way ninety
219,969.41,970.33,3,2,So it's ninety
220,972.32,973.68,3,1,What if
221,971.7,971.92,3,3,Maybe 
222,974.3,978.78,3,1,Yeah I was going to say stick that here let's uh try this
223,973.71,974.66,3,3,Ok let me   
224,979.47,984.06,3,0,
225,984.33,987.03,3,0,
226,987.42,989.4,3,0,
227,990.84,996.09,3,1,So then theory do we have these positioned the same
228,996.12,998.37,3,1,In theory we think this should be
229,999.06,1001.04,3,1,Yes  
230,1006.23,1008.33,3,1,We're close either way we're close
231,1008.25,1010.25,3,3,Yeah
232,1011.27,1013.88,3,3,It's definitely not hundred so
233,1014.81,1020.42,3,2,It's nintey see even for that its
234,1017.16,1018.33,3,1,I think that's  
235,1021.11,1023.93,3,2,It's same see uh
236,1024.62,1026.6,3,2,Here it started to 
237,1029.83,1034.73,3,1,If only our block was a little just narrow sliver
238,1026.75,1029.16,3,2,What if you removed the ten
239,1034.85,1036.83,3,0,
240,1038.24,1041.75,3,2,I think it's eighty now
241,1042.05,1042.42,3,1,Yeah
242,1042.16,1044.12,3,3,Yeah but when it but 
243,1046.28,1051.32,3,3,It's even the same it's this annoying climate ok let me try put in this
244,1047.42,1050.42,3,1,That looks that looks more even to me 
245,1052.28,1054.35,3,3,Oops
246,1054.65,1064.31,3,1,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right
247,1054.83,1059.92,3,3,It's the same ok
248,1064.4,1066.56,3,3,Is it ok
249,1067.82,1070.1,3,0,
250,1071.57,1080.81,3,1,It's I think I think this one's this block is just too flat
251,1076.25,1079.75,3,3,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then
252,1081.32,1083.3,3,0,
253,1083.99,1086.33,3,1,Just to test like
254,1086.75,1089.72,3,1,Yeah I think it's
255,1090.32,1095.54,3,1,They're just too sturdy and flat it's like hard to tell
256,1095.84,1098.9,3,1,We can definitely rule things out but I think uh
257,1099.74,1102.17,3,1,Too crude of a measurement to to
258,1102.44,1105.44,3,1,Narrow down that like ten gram window
259,1105.8,1109.52,3,0,
260,1110.48,1113.69,3,1,Do we want to say eighty
261,1113.78,1117.35,3,3,I'm confused between eighty and ninety
262,1122.09,1124.07,3,0,
263,1133.08,1135.47,3,1,Yeah it's too balanced
264,1136.01,1140.99,3,1,Like have another object
265,1144.16,1145.64,3,3,Uh there's a scale
266,1142.61,1143.83,3,1,Are we allowed to use
267,1146,1161.36,3,1,Well we're not even allowed to use the scale I say we give it our best guess at this point um
268,1155.66,1158.34,3,3,So what should I answer this 
269,1163.55,1165.77,3,0,
270,1166.85,1168.83,3,0,
271,1173.27,1175.64,3,3,We have two attempts to do this
272,1175.85,1185.58,3,1,Ok we have two attempts oh well then let's maybe we just try eighty and see if that's right and if it's not then it rules out
273,1175.85,1188.87,3,3,Yeah we have two attempts eighty eighty is good for three ninety yeah I'm just clicking on eighty
274,1191.3,1198.41,3,3,Oh it's right eighty yes
275,1191.3,1198.41,3,1,Oh we got it it's right eighty yeah
276,1198.5,1201.29,3,4,Ok for the final part of the task
277,1201.44,1206.6,3,4,Read the scenario in the next slide and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block
278,1206.99,1210.83,3,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
279,1211.83,1215.83,3,3,Uh the factory that creates wooden blocks did not send us a second mystery block
280,1218.33,1220.31,3,3,Weights so the second block
281,1224.81,1223.58,3,1,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right
282,1227.5,1236,3,3,The second yes yeah so we have to use only this
283,1237.44,1244.92,3,1,Well I assume we can use the second the first mystery block as a data point
284,1240.92,1247.04,3,3,The first mystery block this is eighty we could just 
285,1247.22,1247.91,3,1,Yeah
286,1248.75,1250.88,3,2,Uh I how
287,1251.12,1254.33,3,2,Like they have two one forty grams
288,1254.51,1268.76,3,2,So it must be a set so we should be able to make every possible weight here with these blocks they have one fifty two
289,1262.75,1266.66,3,1,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got 
290,1268.82,1271.1,3,2,Maybe
291,1272.27,1275.92,3,2,Maybe we must be able to do every weight here
292,1276.5,1282.02,3,3,Yeah the highest we can make is a one fifty we can make a one fifty even
293,1282.86,1288.58,3,2,And we can make it up to one fifty so if we find a block which can make
294,1288.41,1291.65,3,1,So with all of these we can make it up to one fifty
295,1293.03,1298.01,3,1,Ok yeah eighty plus fifty fifty and then yeah ok
296,1298.55,1308.63,3,2,We have ten two tens we have twenty we have thirty we can make forty with these three we can we have fifty
297,1309.08,1312.83,3,2,We have fifty with sixty sixty these two seventy
298,1312.83,1314.06,3,3,Sixty and these two
299,1314.21,1318.58,3,2,We have eighty we can make ninety we can make
300,1315.92,1322.07,3,3,We can make ninety a hundred even one ten even
301,1322.73,1325.94,3,2,One ten ok one twenty
302,1326.75,1330.42,3,3,Yeah we can it's thirty and ten
303,1329.15,1334.28,3,2,Yeah this is four ok one twenty is done 
304,1335.92,1340.33,3,3,One thirty is automatically fifty plus eighty
305,1334.55,1341.96,3,2,And uh one thirty yeah fifty ok
306,1343.08,1348.38,3,3,One forty obviously we can make that and one fifty
307,1342.17,1346.66,3,2,And then ok 
308,1350.501,1353.42,3,1,So we want to guess one fifty is that
309,1348.5,1350.58,3,3,And yeah we can make everything
310,1356.03,1358.01,3,0,
311,1358.22,1363.05,3,3,We have two oppurtunities for that even so
312,1363.11,1374.9,3,3,Whatever like how did we guess eighty like we used only two blocks even for measurement of everything we just used two blocks so I'm thinking
313,1375.02,1377.81,3,3,If we just used only two blocks then
314,1377.93,1380.87,3,3,The highest two blocks may weigh something
315,1381.35,1388.85,3,3,One thirty yeah because we measured this with the help of
316,1381.33,1384.25,3,1,And that would be one thirty right 
317,1388.94,1390.92,3,3,These two
318,1392.09,1397.94,3,3,And with this we measured with these two and with this we measured with the help of these two
319,1394.33,1397.94,3,1,Wait wait wait
320,1399.11,1399.84,3,3,We almost
321,1399.75,1401.36,3,1,The instructions
322,1401.72,1403.7,3,1,We had to they're not the instructions
323,1403.91,1406.13,3,1,The waiver we signed
324,1407.21,1409.19,3,1,Fibonnaci block test
325,1409.97,1414.62,3,2,Yes it's a Fibonnaci series
326,1414.68,1417.5,3,2,One one twenty then
327,1417.77,1423.01,3,2,Thirty thirty plus twenty fifty fifty plus thirty eighty eighty plus fifty one thirty
328,1418.91,1424.37,3,3,Thirty fifty eight one thirty
329,1424.73,1429.26,3,3,Ok let me try one thirty
330,1429.62,1431.9,3,3,And
331,1433.22,1435.08,3,3,Oh what should I index
332,1435.58,1436.33,3,2,The fibonacci series
333,1454.75,1458.72,3,3,Sounds good ok I'm submitting this
334,1464.63,1465.5,3,1,It means we're awesome
335,1464.83,1467.17,3,3,Ooh that's great that's good
336,1472.34,1474.32,3,0,
