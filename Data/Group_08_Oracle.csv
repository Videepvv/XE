0,3.6,5.58,8,0,
1,5.97,8.04,8,2,Or is it
2,8.07,11.55,8,2,Yeah green is for twenty
3,13.08,15.21,8,3,Ok so now
4,15.45,18.21,8,3,I'll just take these off and then we can have a little more
5,18.93,22.31,8,3,I am your in control oh
6,21.66,22.5,8,1,Sorry
7,22.65,24.63,8,3,It's ok
8,25.74,29.02,8,1,Can I add the red one or blue one here maybe it might be thirty
9,25.74,29.31,8,3,Cause yeah
10,32.52,35.67,8,2,So twenty that's thirty
11,36.9,38.88,8,3,Yeah  
12,42.6,47.75,8,3,I mean the fact that it's teetering back and forth it's close enough they're just increments of ten grams
13,45.45,48.72,8,1,Yeah so the blue one is thirty
14,48.78,51.75,8,2,Blue is thirty big blue is thirty
15,45.75,50.01,8,3,Yeah
16,51.87,54.33,8,3,So it's thirty here
17,56.55,64.66,8,2,Did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might
18,58.58,64.86,8,1,Did we measure we didn't measure the yellow just keep one
19,61.33,62.83,8,3,Oh I thought ok 
20,65.67,67.95,8,1,And keep the thirty
21,60.3,73.95,8,2,Let's try both the green ones now I mean both the big ones yeah
22,67.98,69.43,8,3,Let's try
23,74.12,74.75,8,2,Too heavy
24,74.07,76.05,8,1,Oh that's too left
25,76.41,78.45,8,1,Try the right
26,78.51,80.61,8,1,Keep that one
27,84.75,88.17,8,2,What if we do the green one and the two smaller cubes
28,88.53,91.26,8,2,Cause that's going to be pushing that way
29,91.53,92.76,8,3,Gotcha are they centered
30,93.62,95.79,8,1,This is twenty or thirty
31,96.31,99.69,8,3,Let's just make sure I guess they are centered
32,96.06,96.75,8,2,Yeah I feel that way
33,98.25,99.25,8,3,These are ten
34,100.05,106.25,8,2,Green green is twenty so green is twenty and then we said this one is thirty right
35,100.45,106.77,8,3,Green is twenty ok green is twenty thirty yeah
36,107.01,108.99,8,1,But let's see let's
37,114.15,117,8,1,Needs more weight
38,117.36,119.58,8,1,Let's try forty
39,119.76,126.39,8,2,That's too light and we know that green is equal to
40,126.42,128.4,8,2,This one and that one
41,128.94,131.25,8,2,So let's try this one too
42,132,134.91,8,1,Oh it's more than forty
43,136.23,141.09,8,3,So let's see oh wait it's leaning now
44,141.12,143.19,8,0,
45,144.78,146.76,8,1,Between forty and fifty
46,155.4,157.66,8,2,It's definitely not staying in between right
47,157.58,159.33,8,1,Yeah it's more than forty
48,159.64,162.21,8,3,But which one was forty I'm just
49,162.3,164.88,8,1,This is thirty this is twenty
50,162.82,163.58,8,3,Thirty ok
51,163.08,164.88,8,2,Yeah twenty  
52,165.72,166.33,8,2,So what if we do
53,166.66,168.09,8,1,This is more than forty
54,168.21,170.67,8,1,But we don't and less than fifty actually
55,171.39,173.97,8,3,Yeah
56,174.33,175.16,8,1,Twenty plus ten thirty
57,175.91,177.18,8,2,Thirty  
58,178.17,180.15,8,1,Forty
59,183.93,186.24,8,0,
60,187.98,190.38,8,1,Forty
61,191.28,191.92,8,1,Fifty
62,192.41,194.13,8,2,Fifty so heavy or
63,194.46,196.62,8,1,Fifty is too heavy
64,198.15,203.75,8,3,I mean it could be just like how they were placed on like measured at like I don't know
65,197.1,198.92,8,1,Yeah it is between forty and fifty
66,202.25,204.87,8,2,Like can we use a combination of
67,206.83,210.08,8,3,We can't we can't get between so
68,206.07,212.19,8,1,We tried all of the combinations yeah yeah we can try this
69,209.82,211.22,8,2,So we can move one of these
70,213.6,215.58,8,3,Yeah but
71,215.97,220.35,8,3,We know it's between forty and fifty we can't really
72,217.93,219.24,8,1,We can add weight
73,220.5,224.4,8,3,Cause everything else we know is like a multiple of ten so we just can't
74,223.66,224.33,8,2,Yeah
75,225.06,227.49,8,3,Directly compare it um
76,227.73,231.03,8,1,Actually just adding one gram made it equal
77,232.47,234.45,8,1,I just added one gram
78,234.93,237.9,8,2,Oh yeah cause it's a scale yeah so
79,237.08,237.9,8,3,Yeah
80,237.93,239.33,8,1,So it's forty one
81,241.63,243.21,8,2,Yeah forty one
82,246.3,248.52,8,2,So should we
83,248.55,251.25,8,2,Where should we put it then in forty
84,249.58,252.9,8,1,I think actually everything is not round figured
85,253.23,258.84,8,1,Presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure it accurately
86,259.22,261.87,8,3,Wait so is this just in the wrong place or is this the twenty
87,259.11,260.01,8,1,Precisely
88,264.17,271.62,8,3,Is this in the wrong place or is this ok so this is thirty fifty minus one so 
89,263.01,272.73,8,1,Shall we try that no it's twenty yeah one no not minus one minus nine
90,272.91,277.75,8,1,Ok minus one it is yeah so it is forty nine
91,274.25,278.28,8,1,Yeah forty nine yeah
92,275.25,276.5,8,2,Minus one forty nine
93,280.2,284.04,8,3,Ok so it's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently
94,284.34,286.32,8,3,And callibrate it
95,287.28,289.59,8,3,Did you hear that
96,292.62,294.6,8,0,
97,295.35,296.25,8,3,I think we're done
98,297.5,298.41,8,1,Yeah
99,298.65,302.94,8,4,Have you filled out the survey on the computer as well and you guys will be 
100,299.91,300.3,8,1,No  
101,305.13,308.76,8,0,
102,310.2,312.5,8,3,Should we double check anything or just assume that we got it 
103,312.66,315.48,8,1,Should we be precise to one gram
104,318.01,319.92,8,4,Just do rounding to tenths
105,316.92,323.37,8,1,Should we tenths length ok that's fine yeah
106,320.17,322.75,8,2,Ok so fifty is fine
107,323.49,326.25,8,3,Yeah we just got stumped cause it was like
108,326.28,328.44,8,3,Plus
109,329.73,333.66,8,3,Yeah so we're definitely right
110,331.55,332.24,8,2,Yeah
111,336.18,339.84,8,3,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause
112,340.06,348,8,2,So yellow is fifty they said yellow's cause it was forty so yellow's fifty green is twenty
113,342.92,343.17,8,1,Yeah
114,349.74,352.02,8,2,Um purple is thirty
115,353.88,358.05,8,2,Yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten
116,359.16,365.25,8,2,Yeah I was like yeah I was like kind of confused wait what the lighting but
117,365.91,368.13,8,2,So red is ten blue is
118,366.56,366.84,8,3,Fifty
119,369.09,371.07,8,2,Was thirty yep
120,371.1,373.5,8,2,Um green is twenty yep and then yellow
121,374.7,376.68,8,0,
122,379.32,380.08,8,2,Ok which way
123,380.58,381.81,8,1,White block
124,382.26,384.24,8,3,Mystery block
125,385.08,396.57,8,4,Ok now you need to determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
126,384.3,391.84,8,1,Is there any mystery block third weight
127,394.23,395.01,8,2,Nice
128,396.75,399.24,8,4,You will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly
129,399.92,405.01,8,3,Ok so it might have to do with the numbers and stuff but
130,399.27,399.75,8,4,And you can now begin
131,402.01,405.57,8,1,It's like um
132,405.84,406.82,8,3,Either that or we could just
133,406.75,410.1,8,1,I think it's for data reference I don't know
134,410.79,413.64,8,3,Pretty heavy so let's read the numbers to see if we can
135,413.82,415.8,8,3,Notice a pattern
136,417.48,421.38,8,2,Interesting I was definitely right yeah it's definitely
137,421.77,424.95,8,2,Hundred and fifty grams but um
138,425.1,428.34,8,2,I mean we could use a combination of these
139,432.59,438.81,8,1,Actually since the like the density is different we can actually compare directly
140,429.96,431.08,8,2,To see you know how to 
141,439.71,442.56,8,3,Yeah but let's make sure we don't lose our order
142,442.74,450.81,8,3,Um and if you notice they all have this kind of stuff written on them so maybe this is
143,442.92,449.42,8,1,Um yeah green is twenty yep let's check that
144,452.33,453.99,8,2,Well they all say the same thing
145,451.47,451.98,8,1,Thirty or 
146,454.56,456.63,8,2,They all say
147,458.4,460.38,8,1,They all say the same thing actually
148,460.62,464.37,8,2,So I don't think it matters um
149,462.33,464.07,8,3,Gotcha  
150,466.05,475.38,8,3,We can feel a hole right here so maybe we can see how much is drilled out as well
151,475.53,477.08,8,3,I don't want to do math right now
152,475.71,479.76,8,3,This has a forty now give me the thirty one
153,481.65,484.77,8,1,It is twenty one second
154,485.07,487.05,8,1,Yeah this is thirty
155,489.6,491.58,8,1,It has a hole
156,491.94,495.03,8,0,
157,495.63,498.54,8,2,Or let's all like do what he's doing
158,498.6,506.25,8,2,And like like so like we all get a feel and then we could all come up with like a result
159,500.02,506.25,8,3,Yeah I guess yeah
160,502.84,504.34,8,1,Can you add a ten for me 
161,507.36,515.46,8,3,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference
162,516.57,519.93,8,1,Um uh remove the ten
163,525.21,527.64,8,2,Want me to add the green
164,525.21,527.64,8,1,It's that yeah
165,527.76,529.74,8,1,Try that
166,532.65,536.04,8,1,And that just a little bit try that
167,538.29,540.51,8,0,
168,545.52,547.5,8,0,
169,547.89,550.17,8,2,Lowkey add a ten
170,552.33,554.31,8,0,
171,561.63,564.15,8,2,Another ten
172,569.55,571.53,8,2,Too heavy
173,576.925,580.92,8,1,Because after a volume more volume we can't actually
174,584.85,586.83,8,0,
175,587.34,589.8,8,2,That feels more like it I'm going to be honest
176,589.92,592.56,8,3,Ok and then can we like
177,592.59,594.57,8,3,Makeshift our own sort of like
178,594.9,601.05,8,3,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel
179,602.76,604.74,8,4,You guys are free to solve the task as 
180,606,608.31,8,3,Ok
181,608.58,611.28,8,3,Uh it's this one we want now
182,612.31,621.67,8,3,We are like halfway over the edge and we can just barely balance it actually we need something bigger
183,612.24,624.09,8,1,We also try that that is fair if it is the rectangle we can try that
184,624.31,625.08,8,2,The purple is
185,625.62,628.35,8,3,So like what's going to get just like barely
186,630.6,632.94,8,0,
187,635.61,637.89,8,1,It started falling
188,639,643.02,8,0,
189,643.71,647.58,8,3,I think that it needs more
190,648.45,650.43,8,2,Leave the same size though
191,651.54,653.88,8,3,Uh the bottom one shouldn't matter
192,653.91,657.09,8,3,In then as long as we have the same on either side of that line
193,657.42,658.75,8,3,Stacking up
194,659.08,660.81,8,1,Keep it in that sect diagnal
195,664.8,666.78,8,3,How close is this though
196,679.42,676.17,8,3,That might have been it that was three 
197,667.65,669.67,8,2,I think that was on the line too
198,678.55,681.48,8,2,So we said like green was ten green was twenty
199,676.92,679.08,8,1,Fifty plus
200,675.01,680.08,8,3,Let's see
201,682.08,685.11,8,3,I think that might be it should we do it again just to be sure
202,681.84,682.11,8,1,Fifty plus
203,682.58,683.58,8,2,Yellow was fifty
204,686.58,687.87,8,3,Ok
205,685.33,686.33,8,2,Yeah
206,688.56,691.26,8,1,Keep it in that sect diagnal
207,693.57,697.62,8,3,Wait a sec ok so this actually matters how we
208,705.06,707.43,8,0,
209,708.39,711.24,8,3,Well that's pretty unstable right there I think
210,712.02,714,8,2,Yeah right there all right
211,714.84,716.82,8,2,Good enough at approximation
212,719.01,720.99,8,0,
213,722.61,727.35,8,3,Set it like all the way into the center line it's just enough room to support it
214,727.62,730.98,8,3,And I'll just kind of support this with my finger and then I'll move my finger
215,731.34,733.53,8,3,Like if I don't feel weight we can just see how
216,733.98,735.96,8,0,
217,744.72,747.12,8,3,And so that's not close but it'll be
218,747.18,749.16,8,3,That
219,752.61,758.07,8,3,I think if we add another one here but we want to make sure it looks like it's straight up and down also
220,749.85,750.76,8,2,How much weight is that if you yeah I think you
221,751.58,752.75,8,1,If we add it
222,765.33,773.49,8,2,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple
223,765.33,767.58,8,3,So I think that's it
224,773.52,776.46,8,2,Purple and a yellow green
225,776.61,780.78,8,2,And red right yellow green
226,777.31,777.83,8,1,Yes
227,780.96,783.06,8,2,It's ten
228,783.15,785.43,8,2,Green  
229,786.39,790.23,8,3,Do they have that or like maybe ten more I just couldn't quite tell
230,790.89,795.21,8,3,It didn't seem like it took it much to get it to tip but also it's hard to like
231,795.42,800.49,8,3,Yield ten grams of pressure I think it's that
232,797.92,800.49,8,1,Twenty thirty fifty
233,800.76,803.37,8,1,We have two answers right we can give eighty and ninety
234,805.23,807.78,8,2,So seventy yeah we could try eighty
235,807.96,809.42,8,1,Yeah we can try eighty
236,809.23,810.3,8,2,Right in the middle
237,811.32,813.57,8,3,I don't I don't think it was in the
238,814.02,818.72,8,3,Wait what were the ones that we had on there cause I think that might have been the same
239,817.4,820.47,8,1,This this and this ten twenty and fifty
240,818.56,819.42,8,2,Yeah
241,820.74,825.66,8,3,Ok well we added an we used both of these so it's twenty twenty and fifty so fifty
242,822.06,822.75,8,1,Added a ten
243,826.15,829.5,8,3,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety
244,825.84,830.48,8,1,Try ninety nintey yeah
245,830.56,831.99,8,2,Yeah let's have another try
246,836.07,838.05,8,1,Then you can try eighty
247,841.5,842.49,8,1,We can't add more
248,839.67,841.17,8,3,I don't think we have eighty
249,842.7,846.69,8,1,Actually when we added the final ten it was able to to fall
250,844.67,845.67,8,2,It started to tip
251,846.75,851.19,8,3,It was about ready to fall but it didn't fall it needed to be touched so maybe it was a hundred
252,851.82,855.99,8,1,Ok we can try that
253,857.88,858.73,8,2,Uh it was eighty yep
254,858.83,860.08,8,3,Oh ok
255,860.06,862.35,8,1,It was eighty
256,863.48,864.81,8,2,Yeah cause
257,862.56,863.42,8,3,That's interesting
258,865.3,870.24,8,2,If you were to add another ten pounds to make it a hundred it would have definitely tilted over
259,865.2,867.33,8,3,Twenty forty
260,872.67,879.9,8,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery
261,880.71,889.47,8,4,You'll have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey um you will have a scenario on the
262,884.08,885.34,8,2,Ok cool so we could use this
263,885.58,887.08,8,1,Is it the second mystery block
264,891.46,892.8,8,2,Just click next
265,890.82,891.42,8,1,Just right there
266,902.76,906.3,8,0,
267,907.89,911.28,8,1,There is no mystery block but we need to estimate the weight of it
268,914.34,917.79,8,1,Oh everytime it caught item multiplied
269,918.45,927.69,8,1,Or doubled twenty plus twenty twenty plus thirty fifty plus thirty eighty
270,928.02,930,8,1,Eighty plus fifty one thirty
271,931.44,934.25,8,1,You got my point see we have to
272,934.27,934.8,8,3,Wait
273,940.17,945,8,3,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about
274,937.8,938.67,8,1,Understand the question 
275,938.67,942.92,8,2,Create the wooden block do not send we have to
276,945.93,953.91,8,1,We don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing
277,947.5,950.67,8,2,It's just so we have to pass the meter
278,954,955.98,8,1,Even knowing what it is
279,956.82,963.93,8,1,My estimate was like we have two tens when we add two tens we get a twenty when you get twenty plus ten we get a thirty
280,964.26,968.61,8,1,When you add thirty plus twenty we get fifty when you add fifty plus thirty we get eighty
281,968.73,971.31,8,1,When we add eighty plus fifty we get one thirty
282,973.15,980.64,8,2,Cause it's like the rate right of like how we're incrementing or I agree I would go with one thirty as well
283,972.42,973.67,8,3,Oh gotcha
284,972.42,977.75,8,1,Yeah that's what I think yeah that is how they are getting you incrementing
285,982.38,984.36,8,1,What do you think
286,984.96,988.42,8,2,Yeah makes sense cause two tens make up a twenty
287,987.73,989.08,8,3,I think you're definitely right
288,989.22,991.41,8,1,Yeah then you can explain it
289,993.48,1002,8,3,Um I just forget the name of what it's called I don't want to like write it out
290,996.75,999.01,8,1,If you have any idea you can say it actually
291,1003.17,1005.08,8,3,What's that like pattern called 
292,1005.08,1007.37,8,1,Um you can call it a sequence
293,1009.05,1016.07,8,1,Actually the blocks start with the sequence of ten plus ten twenty twenty plus ten thirty you can explain that
294,1020.51,1027.83,8,3,Yeah but there's an infinite sequence I mean you can write that out I just want to keep trying to think of the name because that would be probably easier
295,1030.92,1033.26,8,2,Once
296,1034.31,1036.92,8,0,
297,1036.95,1039.02,8,0,
298,1039.08,1041.27,8,0,
299,1047.15,1049.73,8,3,Each block is the sum of the heaviest two
300,1050.18,1052.82,8,3,For like each new block
301,1055.76,1058.25,8,3,I don't know
302,1059.63,1063.05,8,0,
303,1063.77,1066.32,8,3,Ah Fibonacci sequence
304,1067.34,1071.51,8,3,Yeah the weights are so far we have ten times
305,1071.63,1077.87,8,3,Each value to like one two three four five six of the Fibonacci sequence
306,1079.31,1083.6,8,3,So yeah that was very perceptive nice job
307,1090.98,1093.23,8,0,
308,1099.02,1101.69,8,1,Fifty and eighty right
309,1111.74,1116.99,8,0,
310,1122.96,1127.52,8,0,
311,1128,1134.54,8,1,I type so much
312,1141.71,1143.69,8,0,
313,1162.53,1164.51,8,0,
314,1166.1,1168.59,8,2,And eighty so we're expecting
315,1171.53,1176.33,8,3,Yeah I mean I guess we don't really have a sequential order for
316,1177.11,1181.97,8,3,All of them except oh wait did she give us to the blocks one by one
317,1184.13,1186.17,8,3,Cause we could just say that
318,1182.72,1183.5,8,1,Did they throw it up 
319,1186.62,1190.58,8,3,They're all like ten grams times
320,1191.24,1195.74,8,3,Some number in the first one two three four five six
321,1192.92,1195.17,8,1,One two three five
322,1196.22,1200.99,8,3,Like numbers from the Fibonacci seuquence so we expect it to be ten grams times to the seventh
323,1205.16,1209.08,8,3,Um but it's just cause we don't have orders of the ones that we got first
324,1202.73,1213.71,8,1,Um I don't understant actually you say that one even if it's the same right again if you write ten into one one comma one comma two comma
325,1214.07,1217.94,8,1,Three comma five comma eight it's second Fibonacci
326,1214.23,1216.33,8,3,I don't know I'm like
327,1219.5,1224.81,8,3,But did she give us the blocks one though sorry I'm like literally half asleep right now
328,1221.83,1224.75,8,1,No it's like this and we sorted them
329,1225.23,1225.75,8,3,Ok
330,1227.01,1229.1,8,1,Let's see we don't have any other lead right
331,1229.97,1237.92,8,3,Um I mean we're definitely right it's just like how do we word it um either way is fine like the way we have it there it
332,1235.25,1235.59,8,1,Yeah 
333,1235.58,1236.73,8,2,Makes sense
334,1238.01,1242,8,3,I mean it's it's it's not super accurate but it
335,1239.08,1240.42,8,1,It's the same actually 
336,1242.36,1245.42,8,3,Says the same thing so we might as well just do that
337,1250.07,1252.05,8,1,Yeah it's done
