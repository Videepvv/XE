0,2.88,5.91,2,4,Callibrate my cameras real quick
1,6.3,8.4,2,0,
2,9.75,12.84,2,0,
3,14.82,18.18,2,4,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task
4,18.75,23.1,2,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of these five cubes
5,23.52,32.73,2,4,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um
6,27.15,28.38,2,2,Can we use this piece of paper
7,33.3,36.42,2,4,You are going to determine the rest of the weights using them
8,36.45,38.76,2,4,Using the scale um
9,39.48,45.21,2,4,And you don't need to use the slider on the scale just like round up to whatever like zero so you don't have to worry about like 23
10,46.83,54.78,2,4,Um and then go ahead and place the scale on the worksheet when you've gotten the weight and also enter it into this survey
11,54.9,57.3,2,4,You guys are going to be group two
12,57.63,58.83,2,4,And you can go ahead and start
13,59.58,65.92,2,2,Alright you guys mind if I just start some tests
14,60.84,68.01,3,1,Ok cool no for sure
15,70.05,73.29,2,0,
16,73.32,76.98,2,0,
17,77.07,79.05,2,0,
18,81.33,85.53,2,1,Yeah it's like a bit slow to level up
19,86.82,88.95,2,1,So I would imagine if this
20,88.98,91.58,2,1,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal
21,92.58,94.65,2,2,And I I think they are
22,94.77,97.05,2,2,Especially since it keeps going back in a
23,97.11,102.39,2,1,Yeah they also just look like relatively the same size but they could be different material you know
24,97.37,98.25,2,2,Even length
25,104.08,106.23,2,1,So that one is probably ten grams too
26,102.45,104.75,2,2,Yeah
27,108.06,111.3,2,1,And then if that's ten grams then we have a two
28,112.29,117.87,2,2,So I'm going to hold back on that one because I think it's the heaviest
29,115.73,116.17,2,1,Yeah
30,119.13,120.16,2,1,We can do like the
31,120.5,121.59,2,2,The green one
32,121.74,123.9,2,2,By touch feels lighter
33,124.68,127.02,2,2,And that looks like it might be about even
34,128.52,130.5,2,0,
35,133.83,136.17,2,1,Ok
36,138,140.31,2,1,There we go that's better
37,141.27,146.91,2,2,Well on the first go through I noticed how it bounced twice and actually get some momentum ok so then
38,144.92,149.08,2,1,Yeah so that's probably twenty grams
39,149.97,151.95,2,1,You'd imagine and then
40,152.31,153.75,2,1,The first two are ten
41,154.58,155.34,2,2,Yep
42,155.49,158.1,2,2,Um
43,158.13,164.17,2,2,So knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah
44,164.31,165.67,2,1,Twenty probably
45,165.56,166.59,2,3,Yeah
46,167.13,169.11,2,3,This is what we are looking at next
47,169.26,171.42,2,2,Yeah
48,172.38,174.54,2,0,
49,174.66,176.64,2,0,
50,177.9,179.88,2,0,
51,181.74,184.02,2,0,
52,192.69,195.87,2,1,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably
53,195.93,199.5,2,2,Yeah but it still feels like it's leaning towards the two blocks
54,199.75,200.82,2,1,Oh yeah it does
55,216.87,220.01,2,1,I guess it's leveling out a bit more but
56,220.25,221.25,2,2,Yeah
57,221.4,225.41,2,2,I guess and there's no increment so five so we could probably just go with thirty on that
58,222.5,227.46,2,1,Yeah yeah closest like
59,227.7,230.91,2,1,Accuracy wise so then you know
60,231.42,233.46,2,1,You can do the same process with
61,233.61,236.49,2,1,Putting this on that side checking this one
62,237.51,241.77,2,1,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right
63,242.07,244.38,2,0,
64,247.95,250.17,2,2,So that's the twenty and the thirty
65,255.36,258.01,2,2,It's leaning towards one side a bit much
66,258.08,260.67,2,1,Yeah we could probably try it with just ten
67,261.93,263.91,2,0,
68,264.3,268.65,2,1,Oh not enough so probably
69,266.91,267.33,2,2,Ok
70,269.61,271.59,2,1,Twenty then
71,271.92,275.16,2,2,Oh yeah the twenty and the thirty so we'll go with the fifty
72,272.5,274.25,2,1,Yeah and the thirty so fifty
73,278.58,281.79,2,0,
74,282.99,285.12,2,0,
75,285.15,287.16,2,2,Alright
76,288.12,290.1,2,1,Wait did we mix these up or 
77,290.16,291.07,2,2,No
78,293.66,294.75,2,3,So these are both ten
79,291.91,296.1,2,1,I got no good ok
80,297.06,297.75,2,3,Blue or purple
81,298.74,299.64,2,1,Um
82,300.51,302.82,2,1,I think purple or
83,303.75,309.48,2,2,This would be blue this would be purple yeah I thought they were both blue until
84,303.15,307.25,2,1,Blue yeah no I see that's like a navy blue
85,309.87,311.85,2,2,Question was asked
86,332.49,334.47,2,3,Are we supposed to write on the worksheet
87,335.41,338.13,2,4,If you guys have gotten to the end of that we can
88,334.86,335.33,2,2,Um
89,339.06,340.5,2,2,Ok yep
90,338.52,338.91,2,4,Over
91,339.16,339.42,2,3,Ok
92,343.98,346.75,2,2,Wait a mystery block
93,347.25,348.63,2,4,So
94,351.21,353.19,2,2,Without the scale
95,353.28,357.36,2,4,For the next part of your task you will determine the weight of this mystery block
96,358.26,361.53,2,4,Scale you will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly
97,358.34,358.74,2,2,Ok
98,362.16,363.08,2,4,You can now continue the survey
99,362.16,368.79,2,2,Alright uh we are allowed to use the other blocks in holding the weight
100,381.48,384.42,2,2,Ok so this block is heavier than our fifty
101,384.57,387.39,2,1,Oh yeah much much more
102,396.15,398.13,2,0,
103,401.52,404.22,2,0,
104,404.46,406.89,2,0,
105,412.11,416.79,2,0,
106,419.43,421.68,2,1,Yeah I mean that seems pretty similar
107,429.78,430.58,2,1,That also seems similar
108,432.08,433.47,2,2,Do you want to give it a shot
109,443.04,445.71,2,3,Like all of these
110,453.15,455.55,2,0,
111,456.42,458.4,2,2,All of these together is going to be
112,458.5,458.66,2,2,Fifty  
113,468.03,468.42,2,2,Twenty  
114,468.66,470.55,2,1,Yeah cause that's
115,470.94,473.52,2,1,Forty plus thirty seventy
116,473.58,475.65,2,1,And fifty right
117,477.27,478.57,2,1,So yeah  
118,478.01,480.78,2,2,Yeah we got the two tens
119,481.35,483.66,2,2,Twenty
120,484.65,486.63,2,2,Thirty and then fifty
121,490.2,492.18,2,1,So it's probably
122,492.42,494.97,2,2,I might shoot all the way for the one forty
123,492.66,493.42,2,1,Yeah
124,495,498.57,2,1,I think it's a bit more than the max
125,498.84,502.35,2,1,So yeah probably maybe one forty plus or minus ten
126,502.65,504.63,2,2,Ok is the
127,502.92,504.58,2,2,Actually either one thirty
128,504.87,507.72,2,2,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper
129,513.15,518.4,2,1,No ok maybe we should do one thirty and then
130,513.15,515.18,2,4,No
131,518.88,521.67,2,1,Or one forty and then one thirty if we think
132,522,530.37,2,1,I don't know that's kind of my thought process um
133,524.42,530.37,2,2,I was thinking one forty first as well but um
134,527.5,528.95,2,3,Is it one fifty on here
135,536.82,543.24,2,2,Honestly I still feel like we should go with one forty first and if not we should actually move to one thirty
136,543.33,546.12,2,2,Sorry one fifty since it's on there
137,548.13,548.52,2,3,One forty
138,549.5,550,2,1,Yeah
139,549.75,550.71,2,2,Yeah
140,551.04,553.11,2,0,
141,555.15,557.19,2,1,Is it wrong
142,557.43,560.52,2,2,Not quite correct
143,561.12,563.42,2,2,One more attempt alright
144,524.42,566.28,2,1,So plus or minus ten right
145,567.03,569.85,2,1,So we can try and
146,580.53,583.02,2,1,I don't know it's probably better if the same hand
147,583.92,585.9,2,2,Yeah
148,592.16,597.32,2,2,I'm feeling the one fifty personally but
149,590.79,591.33,2,1,I don't know I mean
150,595,597.51,2,3,Wait what it it again when it's lined up
151,598.75,602.55,2,2,That's a ten ten that's a twenty
152,597.9,599.5,2,1,Um think yeah these are ten
153,602.91,604.98,2,2,Fifty and that's a thirty
154,607.98,612.63,2,2,And we guessed this was a one forty so our options were one thirty or
155,612.75,614.73,2,2,Off the paper
156,616.02,618,2,2,Together that's one twenty
157,623.01,624.9,2,3,I think it has to do with patterns
158,619.95,623.34,2,2,Um personally 
159,625.26,629.07,2,3,Because it says think about the relationship between the weights of the power blocks
160,629.67,632.49,2,3,And if you do like
161,629.58,630.03,2,2,Oh yeah
162,633.6,635.91,2,0,
163,637.71,639.99,2,3,These add up to twenty
164,640.29,642.9,2,3,These add up to thirty these add up to fifty
165,644.79,647.37,2,3,But that doesn't really make sense either I don't know
166,647.49,649.47,2,1,Yeah I mean this could be
167,649.98,655.71,2,1,This set of two adds up to this one and then the next set of two adds up to that
168,655.86,661.77,2,2,So these would add up to eighty and then eighty plus fifty would be one thirty
169,656.5,658.58,2,3,So it would be eighty and you weigh less
170,664.32,666.3,2,3,And thirty 
171,673.68,676.8,2,3,I think it's just the last two so it would just be fifty and thirty
172,677.25,680.28,2,3,I think it just feels like it's
173,680.52,684.83,2,3,A lot heavier because it's denser and like just carrying that
174,682.33,683.66,2,1,Yeah that might makes sense
175,684.83,686.01,2,2,Were we right then
176,686.58,689.04,2,3,No you're wrong it was eighty
177,689.13,690.47,2,3,Cause I think we did one step too much
178,689.58,671.17,2,1,Yeah it's a pattern
179,691.9,692.04,2,2,Really
180,694.74,696.72,2,4,Have you guys finished the second one
181,697.05,698.25,2,1,Um yeah we just finished
182,697.5,700.29,2,3,Is is the yeah mystery block
183,704.37,706.35,2,0,
184,708.83,715.11,2,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the
185,715.23,719.25,2,4,Second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer
186,720.81,722.82,2,0,
187,726.81,730.89,2,3,Well that was our one thirty right because that was fifty
188,731.43,733.44,2,1,Yeah so
189,733.56,737.28,2,1,That makes sense yeah fifty and eighty one thirty
190,741.39,747.66,2,1,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set
191,747.78,753.15,2,1,The like sum of the two previous blocks
192,755.1,757.89,2,0,
193,760.68,763.32,2,3,In order to like
194,763.77,765.75,2,3,Least heavy to most heavy or
195,765.96,772.68,2,1,I guess heaviest to least heaviest maybe because these two add up to that one
196,772.95,775.05,2,1,These two add up to that one
197,775.65,781.08,2,1,These two I guess it doesn't matter which order it's just the sum of the previous two
198,777.95,778.5,2,3,Yeah
199,777.83,778.5,2,1,Yeah
200,783.27,785.49,2,1,And yeah I guess in order of
201,784.33,784.84,2,2,Um
202,785.42,786.66,2,1,Wait yeah
203,789.3,791.28,2,0,
204,792.99,795.12,2,0,
205,801.27,801.92,2,3,Ok we're done
206,801.75,803.25,2,1,Alright cool
