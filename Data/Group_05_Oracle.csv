0,1.89,3.87,5,4,Callibrate my cameras
1,11.55,14.79,5,4,The task you are completing today is called the weights task
2,15.48,20.04,5,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of the cubes in front of you
3,20.25,22.68,5,4,I can tell you that the red cube is ten grams
4,23.58,35.19,5,4,No don't write it down you can flip that piece of paper over and uh you will be placing the blocks where they go on the sheet and you will also be filling out this survey here
5,23.58,24.25,5,3,Can we write that down
6,35.31,37.29,5,4,You guys are going to be group five
7,37.71,45.87,5,4,Um the scale is not perfect and the blocks aren't always perfect so like it might teeter but that's fine if one drops that's like what you want to look for
8,46.92,49.53,5,4,Um and you also don't need to touch the slider at all
9,49.59,55.83,5,4,Um so yeah just place the cubes on the worksheet as well as fill out the survey as you go and you guys can get started
10,59.08,56.94,5,1,Where's the survey
11,57.18,58.09,5,4,It's on that computer
12,58.15,59.46,5,1,Oh
13,59.73,61.91,5,3,We're group five
14,60.08,64.08,5,1,Alright we see we serve it on the end over there ok so we know this is ten grams
15,62.91,64.62,5,2,So we know this is ten
16,65.43,67.67,5,3,Let me reset the scale
17,65.43,74.13,5,1,So you hold that at the end of the scale yeah it goes here ok
18,68.88,74.02,5,2,So we know this is ten set it there for privacy
19,74.96,84.46,5,1,What's this one ok so ok so we know that that one's heavier so ok this one looks relatively the same size so should we see
20,74.85,79.84,5,2,We just want to go pretty pretty heavy 
21,77.25,85.57,5,3,It's heavy yep
22,85.05,85.92,5,3,Sounds right
23,85.25,86.12,5,1,So we could put that there
24,92.25,95.19,5,1,I'd say that's basically the same because it's teetering
25,95.79,99,5,3,Yeah if that's what we're going off of
26,99.78,101.76,5,1,Yeah because it continue right
27,105.42,107.92,5,3,Yep it's an amazon scale we're fine
28,108.33,112.17,5,1,Ok so yeah that scale so these are both ten
29,108.58,112.17,5,2,So these are both ten   
30,112.62,113.02,5,3,Correct
31,113.19,119.55,5,1,Ok so what if if I had that is it one of those that one
32,125.88,128.25,5,0,
33,129.66,131.51,5,1,Yeah yeah I think that's fine
34,131.62,132.99,5,2,So that one's twenty
35,133.33,136.65,5,2,So these are both ten in theory ten ten twenty
36,133.23,134.17,5,1,Ok in theory
37,137.25,147.84,5,2,Yeah so we know the blue is ten yeah
38,137.25,139.67,5,3,So we have there is no red
39,139.81,147.84,5,1,Well no red is given to you that's why you don't need well this is blue that's purple ok
40,147.96,154.32,5,3,So the green we think is twenty ok so let's see we can use our hands as well
41,149.68,151.01,5,2,The green is twenty
42,154.47,159.75,5,1,This is heavier than this one so this is twenty this is heavier than this one
43,156.5,157.58,5,2,Which one is heavier
44,160.38,161.33,5,2,This is definitely the heaviest
45,161.42,163.86,5,1,Ok so let's try purple
46,164.07,168.25,5,1,Ok so that's heavier ok ok so greather than twenty
47,167.06,170.07,5,3,So we have twenty
48,168.46,170.07,5,2,It's greater than twenty
49,170.23,172.5,5,2,So I can put one one and see if it's thirty
50,170.1,173.01,5,1,Right what if we put ten on that
51,174.48,183.63,5,2,Teeter teeter we know it's less than forty and greater than twenty so it's likely thirty we don't have any other options it it's gonna be thirty
52,175.5,181.24,5,1,What if I do this ok so less than forty likely thirty ok
53,184.5,186.08,5,1,Yeah ok so we think purple's thirty
54,185.33,186.08,5,3,Purple's thirty
55,185.92,187.23,5,2,Purple's thirty
56,188.67,199.23,5,2,And then this one obviously is is um purple and yellow this one's yeah it's it's a lot more definitely ok so it's it's more than thirty wait so this one's thirty
57,187.35,197.24,5,1,Ok and then so if I take this one off yeah thirty put that's going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty
58,199.38,200.84,5,1,Thirty twenty
59,200.25,201.26,5,2,Plus twenty
60,201.39,204.75,5,0,
61,205.77,218.67,5,1,This looks almost a little bit heavier but it is it's close enough so fifty is not an option yeah definitely let's put sixty
62,207.25,218.67,5,2,Yeah so I think fifty because this is fifty right definitely less than sixty
63,207.34,211.67,5,3,Yeah I'd make it a five if we had a five option 
64,218.73,226.08,5,2,And this is thirty right and this is ten so that would be forty so it's more than forty and less than sixty so it's gotta be fifty
65,223.92,229.77,5,1,Less than sixty it's gotta be fifty yeah so ok if we filled this out
66,225.75,226.67,5,3,Yellow fifty
67,229.83,230.33,5,3,Ten ten
68,231.34,233.31,5,2,Ten ten twenty
69,231.95,232.33,5,1,Twenty
70,233.58,236.64,5,1,I think this is fifty and this is thirty
71,235.08,235.92,5,2,I think that's fifty
72,236.79,241.5,5,1,And then here let's confirm this a little this here
73,242.34,246.57,5,1,Yeah let's go thirty ok so that's thirty
74,244.17,246.57,5,2,And that one's thirty thirty
75,246.78,248.76,5,1,And then like this
76,249.72,253.59,5,2,I mean I don't I don't think we need to confirm this but we just do that one so I think we're
77,251.92,252.65,5,1,Yeah that's fine
78,254.13,256.11,5,1,Ok cool
79,257.33,259.01,5,1,Yes yeah do you want us to fill it out 
80,256.2,257.01,5,4,Have you filled that out on the survey
81,257.38,259.92,5,3,Yes should I click through it
82,260.01,264,5,1,Well do you want us to hit like the next button right
83,260.01,264,5,3,All the way ok cool
84,266.91,269.49,5,2,Ten ten
85,277.55,285.58,5,4,Ok now you will determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale you will have two attempts to get the right answer and you can now begin
86,270.27,287.13,5,1,Fifty was yellow twenty was yeah we were right oh another block so we hit next on here
87,277.85,273.83,5,3,Green was twenty yep nice
88,289.33,293.88,5,2,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands
89,287.31,289.17,5,1,On the qualtrics survey ok hit next
90,294.42,295.75,5,2,I guess we'll just start with the ten
91,295.17,297.15,5,1,We'll start with this this is definitely heavier than this
92,297.21,298.01,5,2,It's definitely heavier than yellow
93,298.55,300.84,5,3,Pass me yeah
94,297.75,298.5,5,1,Here
95,301.23,303.84,5,0,
96,309,311.01,5,3,Cool I would say it's almost twice as heavy
97,309.58,314.19,5,1,Ok yeah that's what I was kind of thinking but let's see
98,316.35,319.95,5,1,Ok alright so what if we what if we this is eighty
99,317.44,318.42,5,2,This is fifty
100,320.16,328.02,5,2,What if we flip it down there's a letter
101,331.17,335.64,5,1,I would say this is still heavier I would say brown is still heavier than eighty
102,336.72,340.77,5,0,
103,341.13,343.44,5,0,
104,344.13,347.37,5,2,Yeah it's still heavier definitely
105,346.41,347.27,5,1,Yeah
106,347.55,349.95,5,2,I think so
107,348.02,349.85,5,1,Go ahead
108,350.25,352.65,5,0,
109,354.78,356.76,5,0,
110,359.1,361.59,5,3,Yeah I agree I think
111,362.07,364.92,5,3,I'm not very good at hand weight but yeah I'd say
112,363.92,368.1,5,1,Ok yeah so now   
113,368.25,372.41,5,2,This is how much that's thirty fifty thirty twenty so that's a hundred
114,368.67,372.17,5,3,Uh so fifty thirty twenty
115,372.5,374.04,5,1,This is a hundred
116,376.41,378.39,5,1,That's really close actually
117,388.59,393.21,5,1,You try it's close I don't know if it's exactly but it might be
118,393.33,395.88,5,1,We'll have to add one of these and see
119,397.02,403.25,5,3,Maybe we'll try taking off the lighter of that block and do one ten under and then do that block and do one over
120,401.25,405.69,5,1,That's ninety well no well I think this might still be heavier this way
121,405.75,407.73,5,3,Ok
122,407.94,411.52,5,2,I can't tell they're really close
123,410.25,413.52,5,1,Yeah they're close go ahead
124,418.5,421.25,5,2,I mean we know it can't be zero since
125,416.73,418.9,5,3,Feels identical
126,418.92,422.64,5,2,Ok cool
127,425.58,428.01,5,1,Ok alright  
128,428.79,431.08,5,3,Yeah I still say brown is
129,430.06,432.39,5,1,Add that to that add that
130,434.83,442.23,5,3,I would still say brown is heavier it might be a different way of measuring with the palm instead of your fingers but
131,432.78,438.59,5,1,No yeah yeah that was right yeah so add ten grams
132,447.69,449.67,5,0,
133,452.58,454.83,5,3,I'd still say brown  
134,454.98,456.96,5,1,Still heavier you think
135,459.54,463.38,5,3,The distribution's kind of off when you hold them not in a straight line
136,460.9,461.34,5,1,Yeah
137,463.92,465.15,5,1,Go ahead
138,465.94,469.05,5,2,Give it a shot
139,473.46,475.44,5,0,
140,476.22,478.44,5,0,
141,480.36,484.53,5,2,Still heavier
142,484.95,486.93,5,0,
143,489.09,491.07,5,0,
144,493.08,498.54,5,2,I don't know I mean they're really close it's really hard to 
145,498.75,500.73,5,2,To be sure of anything
146,501.18,503.25,5,0,
147,504.09,509.7,5,3,It's werid cause of the distribution
148,511.08,513.27,5,1,Now I can tell that this is lighter than this one
149,513.33,515.52,5,3,So that's a hundred
150,515.76,518.64,5,1,This is yeah one ten
151,516.16,516.72,5,3,Pre red
152,522.61,526.17,5,2,What if we add one more and see if it's heavier
153,520.59,522.5,5,1,I think that's really close I think that's one ten
154,527.67,532.59,5,1,Yeah this feels almost heavier than this one I think one ten is about close
155,532.77,535.05,5,0,
156,536.64,541.05,5,2,Yeah I think this one feels heavier
157,541.92,544.68,5,0,
158,550.2,552.6,5,0,
159,556.05,564.03,5,3,I can't really tell I did that initially
160,557.59,561.33,5,1,Yeah that's yeah wait well did you take the top
161,558.63,560.84,5,2,So we can you think one ten
162,564.6,566.58,5,1,Do it again now
163,568.06,572.5,5,1,That feels closer yeah ok alright so let's go put one ten down
164,567.6,573.48,5,3,That feels pretty identical yeah one ten
165,573.66,576.42,5,3,We're good
166,576.78,578.76,5,3,Cool
167,579.96,595.95,5,3,So it was ten ten twenty um so the hint is think about the relationship between the weights of the prior blocks and use that pattern to determine the weight of the mystery block it was ten ten twenty thirty fifty
168,580.02,583.5,5,1,It was not quite correct no alright alright
169,598.89,613.17,5,3,This is so no no it gets this plus this equals this this plus this equals this this plus this is or this plus this yeah so we're thinking eighty
170,598.68,609.5,5,1,Is this here this is a difference of ten is this a difference of fifty no it is these and this
171,608.67,613.02,5,2,So this plus this equals this 
172,613.26,616.26,5,1,Yeah I mean that makes sense it would move here
173,616.73,630.58,5,2,I mean we can we can I guess we could feel it ok you know what this does feel pretty close I think maybe the distrubtuion just messed us up
174,619.75,623.5,5,3,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty
175,616.62,630.69,5,1,I mean it's green so it makes sense yeah because we got the answer wrong yeah maybe
176,631.59,633.57,5,0,
177,634.2,637.02,5,2,If I hold these together more
178,638.35,646.71,5,2,I think it's just hard cause these are these two are like separate so it feels different I don't know I I it's hard to tell
179,647.35,648.09,5,1,That makes sense
180,647.13,649.11,5,1,He's right
181,649.65,652.53,5,0,
182,652.65,668.33,5,2,I think it's just the extra blocks like having them be seperate blocks just makes it really hard to tell you know which is heavier I only grab by the base right
183,658.88,671.13,5,3,I'm trying to do randomization without here spin them for me yep put them right between my fingers
184,660.64,671.31,5,1,That didn't work yeah you would have to ok alright
185,674.25,677.01,5,2,I'm going to grab both of these by the base
186,682.74,688.91,5,1,Ok let's go with that let's go with eighty yeah
187,683.88,689.4,5,3,I'm not great at handheld weighting cool
188,689.94,691.92,5,0,
189,699.11,698.55,5,4,For the final part of this task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you may now continue the survey
190,692.01,709.08,5,1,Eighty grams alright cool next ok
191,692.31,698.84,5,3,Eighty nice next
192,715.34,718.32,5,3,The factory that creates the wooden blocks did not send us the second mystery block
193,712.38,714.01,5,1,Go ahead and read it I can't read it from here
194,718.35,729.51,5,3,You have two oppurtunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one to two sentences how you determined your estimate indicate the weight of the second mystery block yep
195,726.64,728.76,5,1,If we decide to continue on the pattern
196,729.78,732.81,5,1,One thirty weight makes sense
197,732.99,735.48,5,3,So the pattern is
198,736.53,750.69,5,1,The summation of the previous two which actually makes sense because this ten plus 0 is ten ten plus ten is twenty well yeah but yeah
199,745.75,747.75,5,2,So we're thinking it's like the Fibonacci series then  
200,737.93,749.78,5,3,Of the previous two oh sure yeah pretty much it's the same idea
201,751.86,757.84,5,3,It is actually one one two three five eight one three so you're right it is literally the fibonacci 
202,754.67,761.42,5,1,One one yeah it is the fibonacci ok so go with that we're thinking one thirty
203,763.08,764.7,5,2,One thiry because
204,764.85,768.15,5,1,Yeah go ahead and explain it how you think
205,769.05,772.65,5,0,
206,773.07,776.49,5,0,
207,777.87,781.74,5,0,
208,782.13,784.53,5,0,
209,784.62,796.74,5,2,It's weird because these all together still feels light because you like yeah I think you understand its different blocks or this doesn't feel heavy but when have one small thing that's the weight of all of that it feels heavier that's the weird thing
210,797.16,799.14,5,0,
211,800.13,805.01,5,3,How do you spell Fibonacci F I B O N A C C I
212,803.75,805.33,5,2,Fi B O N A C C I
213,805.5,806.09,5,1,Yeah that sounds right
214,819.6,825.09,5,0,
215,827.52,829.95,5,0,
216,830.73,833.07,5,0,
217,833.31,837,5,0,
218,837.9,840.09,5,0,
219,840.15,843.96,5,0,
220,844.56,849.06,5,0,
221,849.39,853.92,5,1,Typing so diligently
222,854.04,860.38,5,3,Yeah that's one thing that CS has made me better at being precise ah
223,857.18,859.67,5,1,That's good
224,860.57,862.2,5,2,Did you accidentally swipe back
225,862.95,866.01,5,4,What happened
226,867.66,878.7,5,3,No it's the Chromebook if you swip on one side of it ok we know it's the pattern the increasing way the blocks is pattern it's the Fibonacci sequence
227,866.52,871.67,5,1,Did you do the wrong button oh there you go it saved it
228,879.51,881.49,5,0,
229,882.36,889.56,5,3,By continuing the pattern for the second mystery block we got mystery block two
230,890.34,900.78,5,3,Equals prior heaviest block plus the one before that so now the equation is mystery block two equals eighty gram plus fifty gram equals one thirty gram cool
231,894.52,903.69,5,2,So this one yeah sounds good
