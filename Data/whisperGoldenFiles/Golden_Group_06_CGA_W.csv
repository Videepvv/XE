1,63.42,66.0,red = 10,13,59.0,80.13,6,1,"right, so i guess if red block red one's 10 grams. let's see, seems like red block, blue block might be about the same."

5,89.76,91.06,purple > red + blue,20,89.07,90.07,6,1,too heavy
6,102.35,104.28,green = 20,24,95.07,113.07,6,2,this is a sensitive scale. that's looking kinda even. try yellow block big sucker.
8,116.79,125.37,red = 10 and green = 20,28,119.17,121.07,6,1,making sure that purple block didn't have the weight on the bottom.
10,141.18,146.85,purple > 20 and purple < 30,49,143.07,159.07,6,2,"but it almost seems like the 30 takes it past, but maybe not. it's just so sensitive. good god. if they're only in increments of 10"

14,177.57,178.08,yellow = 50,66,177.07,192.07,6,3,"yeah, purple block, green block's considerably heavier, so purple block one, did we say purple block was 30? and blue block was 10."
