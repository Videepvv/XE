0,23.52,26.76,red =10,4,24.0,26.0,2,4,I can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams
1,88.98,91.58,red = blue,23,86.0,92.0,2,1,"yeah, red block, blue block also just like look relatively the same size"
2,104.08,106.23,blue = 10,29,104.0,108.0,2,2,so i'm going to hold back on yellow block one because i think yellow block's the heaviest.
4,124.68,127.02,green = red + blue,36,122.0,125.0,2,1,thats better
5,144.92,149.08,green = 20,47,147.0,151.0,2,2,"so knowing that, uh, oh, sorry, the green one was, yeah, twenty"
7,152.31,153.75,red = 10 and blue = 10,49,151.0,154.0,2,1,probably
9,158.13,164.17,green = 20,52,162.0,165.0,2,1,"20 plus 10, 30 probably."
12,192.69,195.87,purple = 30,59,193.0,196.0,2,2,i guess and
14,221.4,225.41,purple = 30,65,220.0,222.0,2,1,"so then you know we can do the same process with putting purple block on that side, checking yellow block one."
17,237.51,241.77,yellow > purple,69,238.0,248.0,2,1,"Yeah, we could probably try with just ten."
18,247.95,250.17,green = 20 and purple = 30,69,238.0,248.0,2,1,"Yeah, we could probably try with just ten."
19,255.36,258.01,yellow < green + purple,73,258.0,265.0,2,1,ably. 20 and
21,264.3,268.65,yellow > blue + purple,75,265.0,267.0,2,2,oh yeah the twenty and the thirty so we'll go with the 50.
22,271.92,275.16,yellow = 50,77,268.0,272.0,2,1,"did we mix green block, purple block up? or?"
