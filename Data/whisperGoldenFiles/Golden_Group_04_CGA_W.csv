0,33.3,36.23,red = 10,11,36.0,41.0,4,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale provided.
5,81.61,82.96,blue = 10,27,75.0,82.0,4,3,compare let's compare the red to the blue and see if we can get a baseline of the blue.
8,91.14,91.75,green = 20,396,,,4,3,we have completed this task
18,121.58,123.64,purple = 30,55,121.0,123.0,4,1,yeah we can consider purple block to be 30
21,125.49,127.16,purple != 40,63,127.0,129.0,4,2,well purple block's not and purple block's not twenty
23,127.96,129.29,purple != 20,63,127.0,129.0,4,2,well purple block's not and purple block's not twenty
24,129.51,130.62,purple = 30,64,129.0,130.0,4,2,yeah purple block's gotta be thi-
28,157.84,159.83,yellow = 50,83,158.0,160.0,4,1,okay so that we can say yellow block is fifty
30,161.88,162.59,blue = 10,396,,,4,3,we have completed this task
34,174.37,175.44,yellow = 50,100,172.0,175.0,4,3,thirty and so that would mean yellow is
