Utterance,Start,End,Group,Participant,Transcript
0,2.9,5.15,7,4,I need to callibrate my cameras first
1,13.67,16.67,7,4,Okay um and if you could flip that paper over for me
2,18,19.5,7,4,There will be content on that paper
3,22.25,25.23,7,4,Okay the task that you are completing is called the weights task
4,26,30.25,7,4,In part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorable cubes
5,30.9,33.5,7,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
6,34.59,37.83,7,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here
7,39.33,43.58,7,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams so you don't need to touch the slider on the scale
8,44.08,49.58,7,4,The scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop down you can assume that the weights are equal
9,50.58,56.08,7,4,Uh you will place the blocks onto these onto the worksheet once you have determined their weight
10,56.84,59.08,7,4,And you will also enter the weight into this survey here
11,59.47,62.31,7,4,You guys are going to be group number seven and you can go ahead and get started
12,63.87,66.17,7,3,Do I just type in the group number now or
13,65.91,66.01,7,4,Yeah
14,74,74.25,7,3,Okay
15,78.34,80.09,7,2,Let's start with the smallest block
16,93.75,94.25,7,3,Yeah.
17,94.5,95.75,7,1,Yeah almost
18,98.5,101.75,7,3,I think so as well or I think it's the other way around uh
19,105.34,105.84,7,3,Yeah
20,107.08,107.34,7,1,Okay
21,107.31,109.09,7,2,It seems to be ten
22,110.32,111.14,7,3,Yeah uh
23,112.42,114.67,7,2,Is that blue or purple this is blue I guess
24,114.41,115.17,7,3,This is blue
25,116.42,118.12,7,3,And this was ten
26,118.63,119.11,7,3,Okay
27,119.25,123.5,7,2,and we can now we have twenty so we can try to put one of them
28,123.53,123.75,7,3,Sure
29,125.75,127.5,7,3,Oh that's the heaviest
30,128.54,129.82,7,2,Oh this seems to heavy
31,130.34,130.53,7,1,Oh
32,130.82,131.31,7,3,Okay
33,136.92,138.42,7,1,Think it should be
34,139.87,142.15,7,3,Yeah they should be twenty as well
35,145.93,146.25,7,3,Okay
36,147.5,149,7,3,Should I put this as twenty
37,148.95,149.25,7,1,Yeah
38,149.74,150.25,7,1,Green
39,151.5,151.75,7,3,Okay
40,152.57,153.59,7,1,Now it's forty
41,154.52,155.09,7,3,And
42,155.75,156.25,7,1,This is
43,157.59,158.81,7,2,You can try I'm always
44,159.06,160.01,7,1,No no no that's silly
45,160.86,161.59,7,2,I think that's heavier
46,162.17,163.67,7,1,This one or this one
47,163.58,164.92,7,2,eh that one is lighter yeah
48,179.32,181.84,7,3,Yeah I think it's yeah thirty
49,180.82,181.31,7,1,Thirty
50,184.42,184.62,7,3,Yup
51,186.92,187.13,7,3,Okay
52,189.61,190.17,7,3,Ummm
53,192.91,194.92,7,2,So is twenty and there is thirty
54,202.58,204.82,7,2,so is twenty plus
55,205.32,205.84,7,1,Thirty
56,207.51,211.07,7,2,So it's not exactly aligning but it could be
57,209.84,211.02,7,3,No no no no
58,212.15,212.86,7,3,So if we
59,212.92,213.95,7,2,Fifty I guess
60,217.42,217.92,7,3,No
61,226.5,228.62,7,3,Yeah I think fifty seems right
62,227.54,229.59,7,2,Fifty and the purple is
63,230.35,232.05,7,2,Thirty thirty plus twenty
64,233.54,233.85,7,3,Yup
65,234.84,235.34,7,1,Yeah
66,236.42,236.92,7,3,Fifty
67,239.45,240.17,7,1,I'm sorry 
68,240.21,242.67,7,1,It purple is thirty
69,242.23,243.42,7,3,Oh purple is thirty
70,244.17,244.67,7,3,Yellow
71,243,246.17,7,2,Uh it’s not exactly aligning should I
72,246.75,248.5,7,2,So this seem it's little more
73,248.75,249.25,7,3,On the left
74,249.5,251,7,2,Yeah so should I put something here
75,250,251.25,7,1,Do you want to put ten
76,251.58,252.09,7,1,It is
77,252.81,254.33,7,3,We can try it yeah
78,256.03,256.33,7,2,No
79,256.53,256.88,7,3,No
80,257.09,258.58,7,1,I should we should keep ten
81,258.84,259.34,7,1,See
82,260.24,262.17,7,2,But then that'll even this is
83,263.17,264.67,7,2,This is ten ok we know that this is ten
84,265.14,265.67,7,3,Yeah
85,267.67,270,7,2,Yeah but we put both ten so that they cancel out
86,269.75,272.25,7,1,Now it's completely now
87,272.75,273.75,7,3,No it's still on the left
88,276.75,277.5,7,3,You mean like this
89,279.04,281.05,7,2,So this is thirty oops sorry
90,281.26,281.84,7,3,Thirty
91,281.33,282.84,7,2,Thirty plus thirty plus  
92,283.84,284.54,7,3,And then yeah
93,284.59,285.17,7,2,Fifty
94,285.41,285.67,7,3,Yeah
95,297.75,298.75,7,3,So
96,300.75,304,7,1,It's okay or we should just us scale it with this one
97,303.75,307.32,7,3,Yeah how about we try like twenty and then
98,313.42,316.42,7,1,It's it's two gram I think
99,316.67,318.92,7,1,It has until five but
100,321.25,322.25,7,1,we can
101,323.17,323.95,7,3,Yeah it's
102,323.5,324.56,7,2,What does this do
103,325,325.75,7,3,I don't know
104,326.75,328.5,7,1,It's five gram now
105,328.84,332.32,7,1,It's mmm it's this way plus five
106,333.07,333.33,7,3,Oh
107,333.52,334.82,7,1,So you can
108,340.08,341.85,7,3,Oh ok so it could be
109,342.16,344.42,7,1,So you should add something here
110,347.25,347.5,7,3,Or here
111,347.42,350,7,2,So now we're adding three grams where
112,351.75,353.25,7,3,So we're adding
113,356,356.75,7,2,Where are we adding
114,357.33,357.58,7,2,So wait
115,358.33,361.31,7,3,So if you move it there then we're adding like five grams
116,360.42,361.42,7,1,Going to this one
117,361.42,361.92,7,2,There
118,361.94,363.17,7,3,Yeah to that one
119,362.42,362.57,7,1,Yeah
120,363.42,369.92,7,2,No so it's divided it's two point five and two point five so it can't be other five that's not how it works
121,371.42,372.67,7,2,So uh
122,372.58,375.42,7,3,So is it to the right right now like the scale
123,378.21,380.41,7,3,Like the center scale is it to the right
124,380,380.5,7,2,Yeah
125,381.07,381.52,7,3,Okay so
126,381.25,383.56,7,1,But it doesn't have any
127,384.67,385.92,7,2,Are we allowed to ask questions
128,387.15,389.14,7,3,I don’t are we allowed to ask questions or no
129,388.65,393.42,7,4,To clarify you don't need to use the slider at all they will all be in intervals of ten grams
130,394,394.5,7,3,Oh okay
131,394.03,394.92,7,1,Ah yeah because yeah
132,395.42,395.75,7,3,So
133,395.75,397.25,7,1,So it's fifty
134,396.5,399,7,2,So now we've kind of destructed everything
135,399.25,399.75,7,3,Okay
136,403.33,406.84,7,3,So if it's an interval of ten it should be forty but
137,408.33,411.34,7,3,It's more balanced with fifty grams
138,419.25,421.87,7,3,Oops oh I don’t know
139,422,422.5,7,2,Fifty
140,424.5,425.75,7,3,Yeah I think so
141,425.16,425.44,7,2,Fifty
142,429,432,7,3,Otherwise uh like it wasn’t balanced with
143,431.52,432.33,7,1,It's slightly off
144,433.33,435.05,7,2,It's slightly to the left that's what it
145,436.02,436.17,7,3,Yeah
146,438.41,441.62,7,3,But like the scale isn't properly aligned as well so
147,441.41,444.42,7,2,It could be forty but can we measure forty
148,445.5,445.91,7,3,So
149,445.67,449.42,7,2,So that is thirty plus ten so that is purple
150,448,448.5,7,3,So green
151,450.5,452.75,7,2,Purple plus red I guess
152,452.33,452.84,7,3,Okay
153,457.21,457.33,7,2,No
154,457.83,458.06,7,3,No
155,458.08,458.84,7,2,Okay I think it's fifty
156,459.09,459.81,7,3,Okay
157,461.12,462.14,7,3,Yeah uh
158,469.42,469.53,7,3,Yeah
159,470.13,470.92,7,2,That is correct
160,471.42,473.25,7,3,I think so so red ten
161,473.47,474.25,7,2,Yellow is fifty
162,474.75,475.5,7,2,Purple was thirty
163,476.09,476.25,7,3,Yeah
164,476,477,7,2,Blue is ten
165,478.31,478.37,7,1,Kay
166,479.57,482.33,7,3,Update your worksheet and
167,489.67,489.92,7,3,And
168,491.91,492.67,7,3,Green was
169,494.42,496.14,7,3,Twenty and purple was thirty
170,497.71,498,7,3,Yep
171,500.25,500.75,7,3,We're done
172,513.63,517.17,7,4,Okay you will now determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
173,517.67,520.41,7,4,You will have two attempts and you can now begin the survey
174,520.91,521.42,7,3,Okay
175,523.66,524.75,7,2,Without using
176,525.95,526,7,3,Like
177,528,529,7,3,Feels weird to me around
178,530,533.5,7,2,Maybe um maybe first you can try don't say it aloud
179,534.15,537.66,7,2,You can try it don't say it aloud so that we don't biased
180,537.92,538.42,7,3,Okay
181,538.42,538.92,7,1,Okay
182,539.42,539.61,7,3,Yeah
183,543,543.25,7,3,I can start
184,543.21,546,7,2,Should we turn or something so that we don't biased
185,546.75,549.5,7,2,Should we as well I don't we won't look
186,558.08,561.25,7,2,So is it also in like multiples of ten the weight
187,561.66,561.71,7,4,Yes
188,593.42,594.41,7,1,Do you need help
189,594.91,598.25,7,3,I don’t know like could somebody else like try
190,599.75,600.5,7,1,Ok you go
191,600.75,602.82,7,2,ok you both try not to look so that
192,602.78,604.25,7,3,Ok I can yeah
193,606.25,610.14,7,3,I think we have like two attempts to tell it to you yeah
194,610.42,611.66,7,4,Oh you'll input it into the survey
195,611.32,613.92,7,3,Okay so like we can discuss it amongst ourselves
196,615.38,618.67,7,3,Like we have to input it here so there will be like two tries
197,619.92,620.62,7,2,eh okay
198,621,621.25,7,3,Yes
199,622,624,7,1,So it's this last try
200,624,630.5,7,3,No no we can like talk about it amongst ourselves we just have like two tries to like fill it in
201,644.41,646.5,7,2,Yellow is fifty right
202,646.08,646.66,7,3,Yeah
203,666.16,668.75,7,2,I think this is seventy
204,670.25,674.75,7,3,Do you want to like it felt more heavier to me I don’t know
205,675.52,676.09,7,2,More than seventy
206,676.58,679.09,7,3,Yeah like I tried it with all the blocks
207,679.11,683.56,7,2,Maybe um picking like this might also help
208,685.01,687.84,7,2,because you are distributing with three fingers
209,687.11,689.92,7,1,What about put it on one finger
210,691.15,692.13,7,1,Two finger
211,691.92,692.44,7,3,Yeah
212,694.66,698.12,7,2,It's like difficult I'll have to place it for you maybe
213,706.84,708.33,7,1,I think I need more
214,709.41,710.17,7,3,Okay uh
215,710.68,712.66,7,3,Purple was heavier than green
216,714.94,715.92,7,1,I think they are equal
217,716.66,717.42,7,2,Now it's equal
218,717.21,717.25,7,1,Yeah
219,719,722.66,7,2,So this is uh thirty plus purple is
220,722.25,723.75,7,3,Uh yellow was fifty
221,726.5,727.15,7,3,And this was twenty
222,728.25,729,7,3,And this was thirty
223,731.83,732.81,7,2,So this is eighty okay
224,733.03,733.33,7,3,Yeah
225,733.25,733.59,7,2,So what do you think
226,734.33,739.16,7,3,I think I thought like even all of these combined were 
227,739.66,740.16,7,2,How did you hold it
228,740.42,741.16,7,3,Like this
229,741.92,743.75,7,2,Like that like on three fingers
230,742.42,742,7,3,Yes like
231,743.92,744.13,7,3,Yep
232,747.25,748,7,2,Okay so 
233,750.5,752.5,7,3,Yeah like this seems more
234,752.75,758.83,7,2,One two three fingers I guess it might matter which fingers we're holding with I don’t know
235,758.08,760.84,7,3,Yeah like how about you try and
236,766.16,767.42,7,2,Oh maybe I'll try holding it here
237,767.66,768.16,7,3,Okay
238,773.25,774.5,7,2,It kinda feels the same
239,775,758.75,7,2,Can you put it on my these two fingers
240,783.81,783.98,7,3,Yeah
241,785.83,787.81,7,3,Yeah maybe using three would be better
242,793.25,793.43,7,3,Yeah
243,802.57,803.59,7,1,Because I think
244,805.09,807.33,7,2,It's very difficult I don’t know what side it is 
245,806.59,812.33,7,1,Because it's not just when we weighed it’s not just the weight it's could be
246,808.31,817.33,7,2,Like if you pick it up like this so this is why I felt it is seventy is because I was holding it like this 
247,817.67,821.16,7,2,But now it does feel heavier actually now that you mention it
248,821.5,822,7,3,Yeah
249,824.5,826.75,7,1,So how about those two I had
250,829,829.84,7,1,Eh these two
251,829.05,832,7,3,Uh Green was Twenty this is thirty this is fifty
252,838.09,839.33,7,2,Yeah something's heavier
253,839.42,839.92,7,3,Yeah
254,841.66,841.91,7,3,How about
255,843.87,846.41,7,2,Is there a better way to measure it
256,847.39,853.16,7,3,Like if we were just measuring like one block we could just drop it to the ground the heavier one would fall first
257,854.21,854.42,7,3,Yeah
258,854.33,856.58,7,1,Or juggling like this
259,856.61,857.58,7,3,Yeah but uh
260,866.83,869.15,7,3,So you said eighty and you think
261,869.42,873.5,7,2,no I said seventy but now it could be more I don’t know
262,869.66,871,7,1,I think it should be 
263,874.25,878,7,2,Actually feel this is equal to the combined weight of all of this now
264,879.83,880.54,7,2,Is there
265,883.09,884.83,7,2,Is there for which part of the hand is more sensitive
266,886.33,890.09,7,3,Like it's generally this one
267,891.16,892.56,7,3,Like the palm I think
268,897.25,899.02,7,2,This feels very heavy okay
269,901.25,904.75,7,3,How about you hold this in one hand and what we'll do is like
270,905.33,907.58,7,2,Can we like use a string
271,909.33,910.09,7,2,No but we can't
272,912.33,913.66,7,3,Oh sorry no go ahead
273,914.41,925.16,7,3,So what if you like put this in one hand and we like had move like one block from like the other hand to this hand and see if whether it becomes heavier or lighter
274,927.09,927.75,7,3,Uh Okay
275,933.5,933.58,7,3,So
276,936.84,939.33,7,3,Yeah I'll put this here
277,939.91,942.58,7,2,I don’t think the palm is the most sensitive
278,942.09,942.15,7,3,No
279,943.68,948.66,7,2,So if there was a way to hold it like this I think this is more sensitive
280,949,949.27,7,3,Okay
281,950.94,952.93,7,2,This is definitely heavier I feel like
282,955,956.33,7,3,Uh I would right now
283,958.09,967.66,7,1,I forgot the name of that but in the physic when you have eight under um larger area what was that
284,968.16,968.92,7,3,Uh pressure
285,969.16,969.92,7,2,Surface area
286,970.5,971,7,1,Sorry
287,970.75,971.5,7,2,Surface area
288,972,974.5,7,1,Uh no no the name of that in the physic
289,975.5,977.5,7,1,Perhaps I can see the
290,977.75,978.25,7,3,Uh oh
291,978.5,981.5,7,3,Uh I don’t think we can we use our phones or
292,980.85,983.59,7,1,At least I want to see a word
293,984.1,984.61,7,1,No it's okay
294,986.58,987.62,7,1,Density yeah
295,988.01,988.23,7,3,Yeah
296,988.94,990.18,7,1,I think density
297,995.5,997.54,7,2,It could be the same can you try it now or
298,999,1006.09,7,2,So I uh maybe I'll try removing weights and I'll add also weights and then we can try to callibrate
299,1004.28,1006.54,7,3,Okay yeah yeah
300,1013.71,1015.18,7,2,Just keep trying different things
301,1014.45,1017.72,7,3,Yeah now like this is heavier yeah
302,1019.49,1020.47,7,3,Seems closer
303,1023.78,1028.79,7,2,I think we should try very fast so that you become more aware before you get used to it
304,1026.36,1030.09,7,3,Yeah yup uh
305,1031.02,1032.25,7,3,I don't know uh
306,1031.97,1032.59,7,2,Then how about this
307,1035.92,1040.61,7,3,I think good yard uh yeah this one
308,1041.46,1043.14,7,3,So this seems similar as well
309,1045.66,1047.71,7,3,Close enough uh
310,1048.48,1055.37,7,3,Yeah so like when you add like the red and blue I don't think it makes that much of a difference but
311,1055.79,1057.98,7,2,So it's definitely this much
312,1057.33,1062.09,7,3,But it could be this much or like with like
313,1062.11,1063.62,7,2,Like plus or minus
314,1063.59,1063.91,7,3,Yeah
315,1064.65,1064.87,7,3,Yeah
316,1066.19,1067.21,7,3,Yeah like they're so
317,1066.87,1067.68,7,2,Do you want to try that
318,1068.42,1068.59,7,1,Okay
319,1069,1070.82,7,2,So hold it like that because it's more sensitive
320,1072.52,1073.79,7,2,Um Okay
321,1074.82,1076.53,7,2,I'll be adding and removing very quickly so
322,1087.23,1090.21,7,3,Yeah try to hold it like a bit higher I think like
323,1089.95,1091.73,7,2,Yeah don’t rest your wrists yeah
324,1091.16,1091.23,7,3,Yeah
325,1095.27,1095.59,7,1,Yeah
326,1098,1099.59,7,1,This just fits me
327,1106.1,1106.79,7,1,It's heavier
328,1111.67,1112.99,7,1,I think all of them
329,1113.54,1115.94,7,2,Is it the same or now what do you feel
330,1115.16,1118.21,7,1,Yeah I think it's between these two
331,1118.73,1119.82,7,2,Between these two
332,1119.42,1122.47,7,1,Yeah because when you put could you put that on
333,1119.71,1120.26,7,3,Okay
334,1123.98,1127.97,7,1,When you put yeah when you put this one its heavier
335,1128.34,1128.86,7,3,Uh the red one
336,1129.68,1131.21,7,1,the blue the blue
337,1131.03,1131.62,7,2,both are ten each
338,1131.17,1132.67,7,3,Oh yeah uh no
339,1132.77,1135.99,7,1,Now it's they are they feel same
340,1135.21,1139.46,7,3,Okay so it's like either all of these or with blue
341,1140.04,1140.67,7,1,Yeah
342,1140.61,1141.06,7,3,Okay
343,1141.32,1142.87,7,1,Do you want to try that
344,1143.35,1144.92,7,1,I just want to make sure
345,1144.46,1147.61,7,2,Is there a better I mean now we are almost sure
346,1147.75,1147.87,7,3,Yeah
347,1148,1155.31,7,1,We can start with the smaller one we can put on the smaller because it is because it is
348,1152.23,1155.92,7,3,Okay yeah okay
349,1155.61,1159.24,7,2,We have this can we utilize this paper somehow
350,1156.87,1157.11,7,3,I don’t 
351,1160.67,1161.45,7,2,I don’t think so
352,1162.23,1162.53,7,3,No
353,1162.99,1163.89,7,2,Like putting weights
354,1167.34,1170.23,7,3,Or like but where it’s somehow
355,1174.79,1174.27,7,3,Oh I uh like
356,1177.63,1178.59,7,1,I think we should
357,1178.85,1181.37,7,1,You should take it like this
358,1179.89,1181.61,7,3,Yeah hold it like this yeah
359,1183.59,1184.16,7,3,And like
360,1198.72,1189.97,7,1,Yeah it's it's uh
361,1197,1198.26,7,3,Okay what does it
362,1198.83,1200.71,7,1,Yeah I think we need more
363,1200.56,1200.93,7,3,More
364,1208.39,1208.79,7,3,Still more
365,1209.67,1209.91,7,1,Yeah
366,1213.97,1214.23,7,3,How about now
367,1216.73,1219.23,7,2,Am I holding it right in the center I hope
368,1219.43,1220.71,7,3,I think so
369,1223.56,1227,7,1,I don’t know why but because maybe it's very
370,1232.92,1235.53,7,1,Because we need to put them on each other
371,1235.71,1237.25,7,3,Yeah but yeah
372,1239.72,1248.21,7,3,Could you like make it more like no no uh more yeah go right there like yeah like that
373,1241.75,1242.53,7,2,Like this 
374,1243.97,1244.45,7,2,Like this
375,1249.32,1252.34,7,3,So where is oh yellow is
376,1258.13,1259,7,3,And
377,1261.61,1263.72,7,3,I think it's slanted this way
378,1264.51,1264.73,7,1,Yeah
379,1266.82,1268.98,7,2,Is it is it because I'm holding it incorrect
380,1269.01,1269.97,7,3,I think so
381,1270,1271.74,7,3,Can I try holding it yeah
382,1274.5,1276.66,7,2,If we had like a string that could
383,1277,1279,7,3,How about try doing it now
384,1279.12,1281.09,7,2,Okay so we definitely know that this is
385,1281.59,1283.87,7,3,Uh this is the mystery block yes
386,1285.81,1289.11,7,1,So if you oh I see 
387,1289.18,1289.73,7,3,Yeah so
388,1290.48,1291.74,7,1,It sounds like
389,1293.27,1294.72,7,2,You should be holding this
390,1294,1299.25,7,3,Uh yeah how about you add it first and then I'll pick it up and see how heavy
391,1299.57,1300.84,7,2,We definitely know that it's
392,1301.59,1303.87,7,1,Which one is the biggest one
393,1304,1305.28,7,3,So the biggest one is yellow
394,1309.99,1312,7,2,It's not exactly clear
395,1312.94,1313.98,7,2,It's not a good method I think
396,1314.99,1315.43,7,3,Yeah
397,1316.85,1317.76,7,2,It's not a good method
398,1318,1319.74,7,3,Hmm okay
399,1319.58,1325.28,7,1,What about that one but we start from a smaller one we should try that
400,1326,1330.56,7,1,Yeah you um just keep them but from the small one
401,1329.28,1333.31,7,3,Yeah we start from the smallest no uh in your hands
402,1335.26,1338.84,7,3,Yeah like you hold it the same way but we start with like the smallest
403,1343.02,1344.53,7,3,How does it feel right now
404,1344.97,1345.52,7,2,Feels heavier
405,1345.61,1346,7,3,Okay
406,1353.59,1354.31,7,2,Still heavier
407,1354.85,1355.09,7,3,Okay
408,1358.34,1360.59,7,3,I think that would be heavier now
409,1362.34,1363.84,7,2,I think it's the same
410,1364.72,1365.94,7,2,Around the same
411,1365.93,1370.95,7,3,Okay how about uh no no uh could you put the blue one back yeah
412,1371.5,1374.67,7,3,Uh and we'll like remove one of them
413,1378.36,1379.34,7,2,Yeah this is heavier now
414,1379.86,1380.61,7,3,This is heavier now
415,1380.72,1381.36,7,2,The right side
416,1381.62,1382.93,7,3,Okay uh
417,1383.63,1386.13,7,1,What was the weight of that
418,1385.92,1387.17,7,3,I think this was twenty
419,1389.97,1392.73,7,3,Let's uh change this
420,1400.25,1400.5,7,2,Heavier
421,1401,1402.34,7,3,This is okay
422,1403.41,1404.14,7,3,And
423,1406.12,1406.27,7,3,Sorry
424,1423.47,1424.59,7,2,This is heavier right side I think
425,1425.25,1425.98,7,3,Okay
426,1427.54,1429.63,7,2,Now you try because I'm getting used to it
427,1429.83,1431.84,7,3,Oh uh
428,1431.34,1432.09,7,1,Because when
429,1432.61,1434.41,7,3,I don’t okay sure
430,1435.59,1436.1,7,3,So
431,1440.41,1442.09,7,3,I will keep my eyes closed
432,1444.42,1445.92,7,3,This is heavier the right side
433,1450.86,1457.59,7,2,You can always uh like your right hand side you can always put it down and pick it up again because you might get used to it
434,1458.12,1458.59,7,3,Okay
435,1460.61,1462.09,7,3,Seems similar
436,1462.68,1466.13,7,2,Sort of can you put down the right side and pick it up again
437,1469.83,1470.92,7,3,Yeah no this is heavy
438,1471.26,1472,7,2,Right side is heavy
439,1471.97,1472.11,7,3,Yeah
440,1473,1474,7,2,Okay stop stop
441,1474.28,1477.25,7,2,Because I felt that was heavier you felt that this was heavier
442,1477.57,1478.14,7,3,Yeah
443,1478.37,1479.79,7,2,So we neeed to
444,1480.28,1484.11,7,3,No uh when you felt it was heavier it was like this three blocks
445,1485.09,1486.21,7,2,These four you mean
446,1486.36,1488.14,7,3,Uh yeah these four blocks not the green one
447,1448.58,1488.84,7,2,Was it
448,1489.09,1489.33,7,3,Yeah
449,1489.36,1490.38,7,2,So it means
450,1491.46,1494.38,7,3,So it's between like these two
451,1494.82,1507.39,7,3,How about you try uh like try it with this one since we know like that this is the heaviest that we know of we put some random ones uh
452,1515.42,1516.13,7,2,This feels heavier
453,1518.79,1521.31,7,1,Really but it wasn't
454,1521.53,1521.76,7,3,Yeah
455,1524.29,1525.57,7,3,Okay so
456,1526.79,1527.28,7,2,It feel the same
457,1528.09,1528.34,7,3,Okay
458,1532.59,1535.07,7,3,This one which one feels similar
459,1538.66,1542.09,7,1,I think we should callibrate for example these
460,1548.27,1555.57,7,1,No we should callibrate like this and we put other thing and we remove one thing
461,1556,1563.42,7,3,Yeah I think that is a good idea like we use same weights initially and then add like different
462,1563.66,1570.52,7,1,And we add and we don’t say to you that what we add or we and finally we find
463,1569.21,1572.98,7,3,Yeah yeah but you need to like keep your eyes closed for that
464,1572.67,1576.75,7,2,These are equal this is thirty and this
465,1574.56,1577.75,7,1,And we just um mix this together
466,1577.27,1581.5,7,3,That is fifty this is twenty yes and this is thirty
467,1579.34,1579.84,7,2,Oh this is fifty
468,1582.84,1584.09,7,2,Fifty twenty thirty
469,1584.58,1584.85,7,3,Yes
470,1585.92,1588.17,7,2,Also let's do a combine together
471,1587.92,1584.17,7,1,No no just start with these and we add different things until you said they are equal
472,1594.75,1596,7,1,Okay take these two
473,1598.79,1598.84,7,1,Just  
474,1606.09,1606.59,7,2,Feels the same to me
475,1608.09,1608.63,7,3,Okay
476,1609.83,1614.19,7,1,So you should feel those at first that they are
477,1620.49,1621.46,7,2,This is heavier
478,1622.57,1625.59,7,3,Okay uh how about now
479,1631.33,1631.83,7,2,This is heavier
480,1632.59,1633.09,7,3,And now
481,1643.16,1643.61,7,2,This is heavier
482,1644.98,1645.71,7,3,And now
483,1652.79,1653.59,7,2,Same
484,1654,1659.84,7,3,Okay I okay could you like put them down yeah
485,1660.09,1664.33,7,1,It doesn’t feel correct
486,1663.59,1666.66,7,3,I don’t okay so like
487,1667.92,1669.68,7,2,So that but this is equal
488,1670.56,1673.79,7,3,So if like these feel similar so
489,1673.67,1681,7,2,This is fifty ten sixty sixty plus six so this is ninety
490,1674.78,1675.52,7,3,Fifty
491,1678.29,1678.39,7,3,Thirty
492,1681.59,1682.95,7,2,And this is
493,1683,1687.92,7,3,Ten twenty thirty is sixty
494,1684.64,1687.59,7,2,Thirty ninety minus thirty sixty
495,1688.46,1689.42,7,2,Should we lock sixty
496,1690.96,1691.73,7,1,Which one was fifty
497,1692.19,1693.46,7,3,Uh this one was fifty
498,1694.49,1695.18,7,2,You're sure about that right
499,1695.95,1696.21,7,3,Yeah
500,1698.58,1702,7,2,Let's since we already have something let's close your eyes
501,1706,1707,7,1,I should feel like this
502,1721.29,1722,7,3,Which one is heavier 
503,1723.75,1724,7,1,This one
504,1724.25,1724.37,7,3,Yeah
505,1727.28,1729,7,2,This was in the same group right
506,1732.09,1732.62,7,3,How about now
507,1733.33,1734.12,7,1,It's heavier
508,1734.64,1735.09,7,2,Which one
509,1735.37,1736.11,7,1,It's this one
510,1736.42,1736.73,7,2,Left one
511,1737.48,1737.67,7,1,This one
512,1737.87,1744.33,7,3,Your left hand yeah ok this is heavier ok uh
513,1739.18,1739.39,7,1,Yes
514,1740.69,1741.19,7,2,For serious
515,1742.74,1743.67,7,1,Yeah I feel heavier
516,1747.82,1748.23,7,3,How about now
517,1754,1755.31,7,1,I feel heavier
518,1755.89,1756.35,7,2,Which one
519,1756.78,1757.02,7,1,Left one
520,1758.1,1760.37,7,3,Okay how about now
521,1766.25,1766.64,7,1,The same
522,1767.41,1770.25,7,3,Okay okay uh you can put them down
523,1770.37,1773,7,3,So we have like this is twenty
524,1770.87,1771.75,7,2,This is how much
525,1774.5,1777.89,7,3,So we have like two answers and we have like two tries
526,1778.64,1780.89,7,3,So uh this is the
527,1780.94,1782.09,7,2,Do you do you want to try it again
528,1782.63,1783.49,7,3,Nah I think I'm good
529,1784.68,1786.41,7,3,Yeah we've got like uh
530,1786.4,1792.67,7,2,So this is uh either sixty or or eighty right
531,1789.47,1794.58,7,3,So twenty plus thirty fifty uh
532,1797,1801.86,7,3,So like the first option is sixty which or eighty
533,1799.89,1801,7,2,Or eighty right because
534,1802.59,1805,7,2,Because this was heavier that means it has to be eighty
535,1802.63,1808.42,7,3,I think so yeah fifty thirty isn't this a hundred
536,1809.92,1811.09,7,3,Like twenty thirty and fifty
537,1812.41,1815.21,7,3,So either a hundred or sixty no
538,1815.97,1817.72,7,1,I think we need to add sixty
539,1817.17,1819.46,7,2,Sixty or eighty I don’t know
540,1819.97,1822.68,7,3,This was one block that Shadi tried
541,1824,1824.79,7,2,Do you feel it's the same
542,1824.5,1825.68,7,1,It's eighty
543,1828.6,1835,7,3,So fifty plus thirty plus twenty is a hundred yeah and the other block was
544,1835.1,1838.47,7,2,So either a hundred or sixty but that's too steep a jump
545,1840.96,1843.68,7,1,I think we should go with ninety and eighty 
546,1841.43,1844.23,7,3,We could try first eighty eighty first
547,1844.95,1845.45,7,3,Okay
548,1848.75,1849,7,3,Yeah
549,1850.25,1851.75,7,3,Should eighty final okay
550,1854.33,1855.59,7,3,Um oh eighty
551,1862.43,1864.18,7,3,Yup and then let's
552,1865.33,1875.5,7,3,Okay uh ten ten twenty thirty eighty and fifty yup
553,1877.5,1883.25,7,4,For the final part of this task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the second mystery block
554,1883.75,1888,7,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
555,1889.97,1891.92,7,2,Which is the missing second block
556,1910.87,1912.67,7,1,It should be something like
557,1913.67,1915.09,7,2,The second mystery block
558,1915.67,1923.42,7,3,Does this not seem like the Fibonacci sequence like one one two three five eight and then one thirty
559,1924.25,1924.5,7,1,Yeah
560,1928.33,1928.58,7,3,Yeah
561,1930.09,1937.84,7,2,One one two three five yeah yeah
562,1936.33,1937.17,7,3,Five plus three eight
563,1938.17,1940.92,7,2,So that should be eight plus five so thirteen
564,1940.42,1940.67,7,3,Which is
565,1943.42,1944.17,7,1,Are we sure
566,1944.92,1945.42,7,3,I like
567,1947.5,1950.18,7,3,Yeah like it seems the obvious pattern
568,1955.25,1955.5,7,3,Okay
569,1958.09,1959.09,7,1,We can't have
570,1960.84,1970.84,7,1,Actually we can't have forty because we have this one we can't have sixty we have this seventy we have these two eighty
571,1971.78,1974.09,7,1,But we can't oh yeah it's it's Fibonacci
572,1978,1978.75,7,3,Yeah like if
573,1980.09,1980.75,7,3,I think so
574,1980.59,1981.85,7,2,Yeah one thirty
575,1981.89,1983.85,7,3,Okay um
576,1990.59,1992.09,7,3,If anybody else wants to type
577,2015.32,2015.58,7,3,Yeah
578,2019.89,2023.84,7,1,Maybe we should guess the weight of that with Fibonacci as well
579,2025,2026.5,7,2,Yeah that was one thirty so it'll be
580,2026.47,2029.47,7,1,No I mean this one based on the other
581,2027.5,2033.5,7,3,This one yeah so one one two three five and then three plus five is eight
582,2033.52,2033.85,7,1,Yeah
583,2034.31,2034.47,7,3,Yeah 
584,2050.5,2051.25,7,3,I think so
585,2052.08,2057.25,7,2,We placed the in the correct position so it was easy to see that they fit into the Fibonacci series
586,2057.42,2060.24,7,3,Yeah I think that is fine
587,2063.17,2063.21,7,3,Yeah
588,2064.17,2064.67,7,1,Hey
589,2070.42,2071,7,1,Are we done
