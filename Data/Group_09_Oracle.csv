0,2.43,5.7,9,4,Gonna callibrate my cameras
1,12.39,16.2,9,4,Ok the task you are completing today is called the weights task
2,16.74,21.03,9,4,In the first part you guys are going to work together to determine the weights of these cubes
3,22.14,24.27,9,4,The red cube is ten grams
4,24.69,28.35,9,4,You are going to determinet the weights of the remaining cubes using this scale
5,29.1,33.12,9,4,Uh the weights are all in intervals of ten so you don't need to use the slider at all
6,33.39,36.42,9,4,All of the weights er ah sorry the scale is not perfect
7,36.66,41.1,9,4,So as long as it doesn't drop to one side the swaying is probably even
8,42.57,46.89,9,4,And if you can place the cubes on the worksheet as you go as well as fill out the survey
9,47.46,52.77,9,4,Alright here you guys are going to be group nine and you can go ahead and get started
10,54.15,57.66,9,3,Let's go
11,59.13,61.11,9,0,
12,61.74,63.4,9,2,I would say that's equal probably
13,63.51,65.73,9,3,Looks equal yeah get
14,70.83,73.95,9,0,
15,77.08,77.75,9,1, I would say that's equal
16,77.85,79.58,9,3,Yeah it should be same I guess
17,78.25,79.01,9,2,Yeah that 's good
18,79.83,82.33,9,1,Yeah ok so that one will go
19,85.32,87.3,9,0,
20,91.05,93.03,9,3,I think it's the
21,96.66,97.83,9,2,Yeah it's probably equal
22,99.63,101.61,9,0,
23,103.33,105.99,9,1,So we got ten ten
24,107.83,108.58,9,3,That's not
25,108.23,111.27,9,1,Definitely not equal
26,112.29,115.38,9,0,
27,117.03,119.25,9,0,
28,121.26,122.25,9,2,Ok  
29,123.02,123.5,9,1,Sweet
30,128.16,130.14,9,0,
31,130.26,133.35,9,1,That was twenty and ten right ok
32,131.58,132.83,9,3,That was twenty ten yep
33,133.38,135.67,9,1,Look we have the thirty gram block and then
34,135.33,136.77,9,3,I think yep
35,137.46,140.04,9,1,And then we can do
36,140.7,146.1,9,1,The two the yellow and green I don't know just kidding
37,147.78,150.69,9,0,
38,160.22,164.84,9,2,Just like ever so slightly though so it's probably probably say that's equal
39,161.92,164.17,9,1,Oh yeah ok oh never mind ok 
40,159.72,167.91,9,3,I think it's sixty so this one was twenty
41,168.42,170.83,9,3,This one was thirty so this should be fifty less
42,171.75,173.75,9,1,Ok good deal
43,174.81,176.91,9,3,And then  
44,179.1,181.08,9,0,
45,181.11,183.48,9,0,
46,186.51,188.61,9,3,Yellow is
47,203.76,205.74,9,3,Can I do it
48,205.8,206.85,9,2,Yeah think so
49,206.97,207.99,9,1,Yeah yeah looks right
50,208.26,210.3,9,0,
51,210.81,215.88,9,3,So it is ten yellow is fifty that's right green is twenty
52,216.03,222.27,9,3,Yeah we are right which one is mystery block
53,223.41,225.93,9,0,
54,228.38,232.56,9,4,Ok now you will determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
55,226.17,227.15,9,1,Ah
56,232.59,238.62,9,4,You will have you will have two attempts to uh enter the weight correctly and you can now begin
57,232.59,233.83,9,3,Without using scale
58,243.39,247.29,9,3,Interesting it's heavier than that one so
59,247.95,251.4,9,0,
60,251.64,254.22,9,3,It's heavier than this too as well
61,254.85,257.61,9,0,
62,258.15,260.49,9,0,
63,265.44,265.99,9,3,Maybe
64,266.42,266.67,9,1,Maybe
65,266.92,267.95,9,2,I don't know if I trust you
66,272.49,276.51,9,3,Maybe it will right I'm not sure
67,279.15,281.37,9,2,Honestly this one feels heavier still
68,280.15,280.83,9,3,Yeah
69,281.67,292.59,9,3,I feel like I'm going to do a comparison between like how heavy this one feels compared to was this the this was our heaviest right before oh the yellow one's heaviest compared and then compared to
70,288.33,290.17,9,3,No the yellow one is the heaviest
71,298.56,306.24,9,1,Yeah I feel like oh we got all the way up to like one forty ok just kidding I thought it was just up to seventy I was like we'll just go with our maximum
72,308.76,314.07,9,3,Yeah so I guess it's fifty plus thirty eighty then forty
73,314.34,318.24,9,3,One twenty it's higher than one twenty at least so maybe
74,318.3,318.92,9,3,I don't know this
75,319.65,321.04,9,2,I'd say it's probably at least one forty
76,321.01,321.99,9,1,So one forty
77,327.15,329.79,9,3,It can't be one fifty or we'll have the option of one fifty
78,322.86,326.03,9,3,The red on the bottom for us
79,333.63,336.51,9,2,I don't think it's one thirty
80,336.99,340.35,9,3,Ok so it's either one forty and one fifty ok
81,337.92,339.42,9,2,I feel like yeah
82,340.71,342.63,9,3,Let's go with first start with one forty
83,341.82,345.51,9,1,Let's do one forty we'll split the difference but not really
84,346.62,348.6,9,0,
85,352.22,355.14,9,3,So we were wrong I guess then one fifty
86,351.42,351.11,9,1,Fifty yeah
87,355.56,357.54,9,2,That's what I would say
88,368.01,374.61,9,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block
89,360.33,365.91,9,3,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's 
90,361.17,367.17,9,1,Eighty that's not right it's
91,374.88,379.04,9,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
92,389.08,384.87,9,3,Um it's saying unable to connect our servers please shut internet servers and try again
93,387.69,389.92,9,2,Like no shot this is eighty grams
94,392.42,393.3,9,1,Abosolutely no way
95,394.26,396.17,9,2,Unless they lied like
96,396.02,400.53,9,3,Yeah ok there's a mystery block two
97,397.5,398.91,9,1,Maybe
98,417.72,420.63,9,1,So we have a second mystery block that we don't know the weight of
99,420.75,421.05,9,3,Yeah
100,421.25,422.73,9,1,Could we just
101,423.15,425.5,9,1,Haven't we don't even have at all ok
102,424.5,427.38,9,3,Yeah we just have to guess
103,427.71,429.69,9,0,
104,430.65,432.66,9,2,So we we have two tens
105,433.11,441.39,9,3,Yeah that was fifty um was twenty and this one was thirty
106,433.33,434.01,9,2,Two tens
107,434.08,436.58,9,1,What was this like was that fifty
108,441.48,444.24,9,3,This one was two eighty
109,454.41,459.18,9,2,I mean if you like sum these two you get that one and if you sum these two you get this one
110,456.83,458.08,9,3,Yeah um
111,459.42,462.78,9,2,Sum these two you get that one so this one should be eighty
112,460.38,461.92,9,3,So it's kind of fibonacci series
113,464.04,465.52,9,2,And then these two should be one thirty
114,464.04,466.67,9,3,One thirty
115,467.67,469.38,9,1,I would say that's sound logic
116,472.83,475.44,9,0,
117,476.16,481.17,9,3,What do you want me to write
118,481.59,482.92,9,2,Um that's fibonacci series right
119,482.83,486.51,9,1,Yeah fibonacci sure yeah seems like fib
120,486.69,491.79,9,0,
121,487.33,484.42,9,1,Unless it's not
122,492.66,495.17,9,2,Some mathmatical thing
123,493.92,497.7,9,1,Some sort of counting upwards by combining them
124,500.46,502.89,9,3,Call it swerve yeah
125,502.92,506.76,9,3,Fibonacci
126,506.79,509.76,9,2,I think there's two c's in there
127,513.33,515.31,9,2,I I really don't know actually
128,515.43,518.52,9,3,Me neither looks right are you alright
129,515.92,520.95,9,1,Looks kind of right yeah I like it
130,523.02,523.75,9,3,Yeah you alright
131,524.17,526.98,9,2,Yes yes
132,524.56,524.85,9,1,Yes  
133,529.83,532.71,9,0,
