0,3.09,6.9,6,4,I need to callibrate my cameras and then we can get started
1,11.19,14.61,6,4,The task that you will be completing today is called the weights task
2,15.03,20.61,6,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these colorful cubes here
3,21.12,24.51,6,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
4,25.44,30.93,6,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten so you don't need to use the slider at all
5,31.35,38.25,6,4,Um the scale like is a little bit finnicky but like as long as it doesn't drop down it's probably good like you can see right now it's
6,39.75,47.55,6,4,Um so as you work through the tasks if you can place the cubes on the sheet where they go and also fill out the survey
7,47.82,50.79,6,4,Um that is on this computer
8,51,57.09,6,4,With the answers and you guys are going to be group number six and you can now start the survey
9,61.23,64.67,6,1,I guess if this red one's ten grams
10,63.42,66,6,2,We got red ten
11,66.36,68.34,6,0,
12,72.45,76.17,6,1,Seems like it might be about the same
13,80.52,85.29,6,3,I would agree yeah so this one's ten
14,85.47,86.92,6,3,Alright let's see if we can find a twenty
15,89.76,91.06,6,3,Too heavy so
16,91.17,93.15,6,2,Way too heavy
17,93.36,96.63,6,0,
18,97.44,99.78,6,2,This is a sensitive scale
19,102.35,104.28,6,2,Looks like about twenty
20,102.3,103.5,6,1,That's looking pretty even
21,104.76,109.2,6,3,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty
22,110.82,113.19,6,1,So this one is noticeably heavier than
23,109.44,110.75,6,2,Probably that big sucker
24,113.94,115.95,6,1,The purple ish one
25,119.42,121.75,6,1,Making sure that it didn't have the weight at the bottom
26,116.79,125.37,6,2,It's just different at the bottom that's a so that's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking
27,125.49,127.47,6,2,Well
28,127.62,130.21,6,2,Their increments of ten I would say that's probably
29,130.42,131.76,6,1,Yeah I think
30,130.66,135.96,6,2,Cause that's also a twenty let's double check that that's not also a twenty
31,131.79,132.58,6,1,Yeah it looks a little
32,136.44,141.09,6,2,Cause it um just that one there
33,137.36,138.33,6,3,Is this one a twenty
34,141.18,146.85,6,2,Ok so it's more than twenty but it almost seems like the thirty takes it past but
35,148.2,150.18,6,2,It's so sensitive
36,157.58,159.58,6,2,If they're only in increments of ten it has to be
37,156.33,161.08,6,1,I think yeah it has to be thirty it 
38,160.58,162.57,6,3,I think it could also be the position
39,164.46,166.67,6,2,So big blue is probably thirty
40,162.84,163.67,6,3,Of the weight
41,168.42,171.21,6,1,So I would guess the yellow one is gonna be
42,172.35,174.33,6,1,Forty
43,175.11,177.48,6,0,
44,177.57,178.08,6,2,Fifty
45,178.12,179.55,6,3,Fifty
46,180.33,182.31,6,1,Oh maybe not
47,186.24,190.92,6,3,Yeah that's considerably heavier so this one did we say this was thirty
48,191.01,192.58,6,3,And this was ten
49,192.61,195.21,6,2,Yeah that's thirty green is twenty
50,195.24,196.42,6,2,Red and small blue are both ten
51,196.52,199.41,6,3,It's definitely not thirty so it has to
52,201.21,202.25,6,3,But it's too heavy
53,202.58,203.97,6,1,So that's
54,205.44,209.58,6,1,This is fifty on here so then
55,208.08,209.08,6,3,Yeah fifty
56,208.84,211.5,6,2,Yeah green and big blue
57,211.56,222.66,6,3,Did we try forty we did try forty because this one's thirty and then this one's or this one's twenty so this
58,211.56,211.92,6,1,Big blue
59,215.67,219.67,6,2,Unless she's messing with us and some of these are in increments of five
60,224.5,226.56,6,2,So that should be forty right there
61,223.5,226.56,6,1,Big blue was forty
62,239.41,243.39,6,2,I would say yellow is like forty five but we could say fifty since we're
63,237.36,240.75,6,1,I would say that it is at least closest to fifty
64,243.57,246.33,6,2,Forced with these
65,246.39,248.73,6,1,Alright
66,249.6,251.94,6,0,
67,253.86,255.84,6,2,Sweet
68,258.08,261.46,6,4,Have you filled it out on the computer you guys are group six
69,256.35,257.34,6,3,I think we're done
70,261.83,264.54,6,2,Ok nice
71,264.99,267.66,6,0,
72,268.74,271.38,6,1,Yellow is fifty
73,273.39,278.25,6,2,Green's twenty big blue's thirty
74,278.11,279.48,6,3,Yeah I guess that one's
75,280.11,286.44,6,3,I think that one's purple so blue was ten and then purple was thirty
76,282.21,282.5,6,2,Oh that's purple you're right
77,286.5,288.48,6,2,Yes
78,288.87,290.85,6,0,
79,291.99,299.55,6,3,So red was ten yellow was fifty we're great
80,294.75,295.92,6,2,We got it right good job team
81,299.58,303.72,6,0,
82,304.38,308.52,6,4,You need to now determine the weight of this mystery block
83,308.82,314.61,6,4,Without using the scale you will have two attempts to enter it correctly onto this survey and you can now begin
84,314.94,315.58,6,3,Alright guys
85,315.66,318.27,6,2,Fun oh boy
86,318.33,320.7,6,3,Is it heavy
87,321.27,324.69,6,2,We should each do it separate and see what we think
88,324.75,325.91,6,3,Just don't say it until you
89,325.75,327.51,6,2,Yeah exactly
90,329.28,331.56,6,0,
91,331.65,336.15,6,3,Oh I guess we can see it
92,339.33,340.16,6,2,Ok  
93,348.12,350.79,6,0,
94,353.88,355.86,6,0,
95,358.83,360.81,6,0,
96,368.76,374.55,6,2,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be
97,375.48,377.46,6,0,
98,380.83,383.46,6,2,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules
99,377.79,381.02,6,1,I don't think she intends for us
100,385.26,388.8,6,2,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do
101,389.01,390.99,6,4,You guys are just problem solving
102,395.16,399.72,6,2,That's about as even as I can get it unless somebody can
103,394.59,395.67,6,3,I like your idea
104,399.75,402.75,6,2,We're getting close
105,402.9,405.18,6,0,
106,406.41,412.14,6,2,But let's let him do hands and then we'll we'll play with that but I'm thinking
107,412.65,414.66,6,2,More right yeah
108,416.22,419.4,6,2,Yeah maybe one of these
109,417.17,418.42,6,3,I'm interested in this
110,419.94,422.1,6,0,
111,422.19,424.8,6,3,Oh that's a heavy one
112,424.95,427.35,6,2,Yeah
113,427.47,429.9,6,3,Ok
114,432.21,437.07,6,2,Yeah so if you held if you hold them all in one and like yeah
115,434.56,435.84,6,3,Which ones twenty this one
116,437.4,439.38,6,2,Um yeah
117,443.31,447.78,6,2,So now you've got forty on there now you've got
118,449.16,451.89,6,0,
119,452.79,463.65,6,1,Let's see how callibrated this is or
120,457.84,463.65,6,2,Yeah oh yeah yeah put your ten and your ten let's callibrate our little scale
121,465.93,467.67,6,2,So even when they're equal it leans
122,466.92,470.85,6,1,It leans slowly that way
123,472.38,474.9,6,1,Let's try the thirty and then
124,474.99,481.42,6,1,Purple and then let's put green and a ten
125,479.83,483.6,6,3,Alright alright lemme just lemme just give it a go here
126,483.72,488.91,6,3,Alright so how much do we have here one twenty total
127,486.47,487.67,6,2,One twenty total
128,491.66,495.67,6,2,That felt to me like it was heavier than all of those
129,488.94,498.63,6,3,So it's gotta be like a like heavier so it's over one twenty we know that so it's over one twenty
130,498.84,504.3,6,3,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say
131,500.01,500.92,6,2,I would agree with that
132,504.51,508.32,6,3,We've only got two choices above oh we have three choices above
133,509.22,514.25,6,1,Well and it could be past the end of sheet if they're trying to be tricky
134,513.92,517.68,6,2,Yeah she gives us up to one fifty on our survey
135,519.25,529.86,6,2,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up
136,520.75,523.5,6,1,Let me see um yes I can 
137,518.46,519.42,6,3,Alright let me see  
138,530.22,532.84,6,1,Drink enough coffee until it weighs the weight is
139,531.34,532.48,6,2,What's the what's the
140,532.95,534.84,6,3,How much is the yellow one again
141,534.93,535.84,6,2,That one was fifty
142,536.31,537.18,6,3,Fifty
143,537.45,539.94,6,3,Alright so I would say I would say
144,540.57,545.07,6,3,We have one twenty we got at least forty so I would say one sixty
145,545.19,548.16,6,3,So one fifty is the highest yeah
146,546.15,546.56,6,2,Yeah
147,548.22,550.91,6,2,I'm I'm good with it it's real heavy
148,558.75,553.77,6,3,Here if anybody wants to yeah it's heavy
149,554.37,556.41,6,0,
150,556.95,560.34,6,3,These are the only I would go higher than one fifty
151,559.08,560.34,6,2,Yeah
152,560.49,564.03,6,1,See if some of these blocks weigh similar to my coffee
153,560.92,562.84,6,2,That's definitely our only options
154,566.55,568.77,6,3,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though
155,570.05,572.25,6,2,If he just said it off the bat I would be like wow
156,569.13,577.86,6,1,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three
157,575.5,576.02,6,3,Alright 
158,578.37,589.08,6,1,So we can use that as an estimate or we can but we know how much these three weigh and if its about the same as the coffee
159,581.25,587.08,6,3,Yeah we don't know how much the coffee weighs though true
160,589.95,593.42,6,2,Oh then we can start adding more is what he's saying ok got it
161,589.83,594.36,6,3,Then yeah the coffe oh ok 
162,594.66,601.74,6,2,So and these three would be yellow purple and blue which would be a hundred right no ninety
163,602.49,605.4,6,1,Yeah it's view unseen feel it and make sure it's
164,602.49,603.08,6,2,So
165,606.21,608.19,6,1,Roughly the same
166,608.52,611.46,6,0,
167,611.88,615.87,6,2,Sure this might even be a tad tad heavier but
168,616.53,618.51,6,0,
169,620.4,623.22,6,2,Sorry
170,624.84,628.75,6,2,I mean that does seem like we're getting closer interesting
171,627.25,630.72,6,3,So what do you have there two hundred
172,631.65,639.24,6,2,Yeah ninety plus ninety so one eighty yeah I think the heaviest option and if it's wrong go one forty
173,634.08,636.92,6,3,One eighty yeah
174,639.75,642.99,6,2,And we get two tries
175,644.25,646.23,6,2,Here's a hint
176,648.42,650.76,6,3,Ah think of a pattern
177,648.66,649.25,6,1,Oh
178,652.14,654.12,6,1,Ten ten
179,655.41,657.39,6,1,Twenty
180,658.35,663.57,6,1,Thirty oh it's the sum of the previous two weights
181,664.14,668.58,6,1,Ten and ten make twenty ten and twenty make thirty twenty thirty fifty
182,669.24,671.22,6,2,Fifty thirty eighty
183,672,679.25,6,2,There's no way that's eighty it feels way heavier but the pattern sticks
184,675.75,679.5,6,3,Hey I'm that's some sound logic right there yeah
185,680.94,682.02,6,3,I like that idea
186,687.67,693.21,6,3,Cause it's definitely not one fifty anyways so we might as well just
187,684.75,687.25,6,2,Yeah I guess now that my I mean
188,696.24,701.5,6,3,What do you guys think that makes sense yeah
189,697.35,702.6,6,1,I I feel like it it I think it feels heaiver but
190,705.18,712.56,6,2,Why can't I think of what this pattern is right now the name for this pattern fib yeah so are we we're doing fib
191,707.68,710.84,6,3,What do you no so like here here's the first one yeah
192,708.08,710.33,6,1,It's the fibonacci sequence
193,712.77,715.23,6,2,So then that would be there
194,717.08,720.01,6,3,Are you guys good with eighty
195,715.95,725.01,6,2,It's a good I mean it's the best we got I'm I'm ok with it I stand I stand to lose nothing here
196,720.66,723.5,6,1,Yeah I'll be willing to trust the hint
197,726.15,728.01,6,2,We got it so given the hint
198,725.16,729.87,6,3,Eighty grams we're geniuses
199,732.43,734.04,6,3,It's way heavier than eighty
200,730.62,732.75,6,2,Our system felt like way heavier to me
201,739.17,746.34,6,4,For the final part of the task read the scenario survey and estimate the weight of the 
202,734.13,735.08,6,1,We're done with this part 
203,734.63,740.83,6,3,Yeah I think that's an idication of the alright can we get the scale back real quIck
204,734.16,737.33,6,2,Yeah I want to see these on a scale full of
205,746.4,752.16,6,4,Of the missing second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
206,752.25,758.4,6,2,Yeah I mean we feel like we're there already so fifty plus eighty is one thirty
207,758.91,761.46,6,2,So I'd say a missing would be one thirty
208,761.67,764.28,6,2,And I would say the explanation is fib
209,764.46,766.44,6,0,
210,768.42,771.67,6,3,Alright so one thirty then
211,769.5,772.53,6,2,Yep yep
212,776.16,779.17,6,3,One or two sentences who wants to be a literary
213,780.48,781.33,6,1,I've got it
214,781.41,784.08,6,2,Cool
215,784.68,786.66,6,2,Given the clue
216,789.83,792.27,6,2,Yeah I wouldn't have picked that up that's fun
217,795.12,798.3,6,0,
218,799.62,801.6,6,0,
219,805.11,808.47,6,0,
220,810.18,812.19,6,0,
221,812.43,815.4,6,2,eighty plus fifty plus
222,815.82,817.8,6,0,
223,820.8,822.96,6,0,
224,824.84,826.11,6,1,Did it
225,823.77,824.75,6,2,We're done  
226,827.97,829.95,6,0,
