0,3.9,5.9,10,4,Let me Calibrate my cameras real quick.
1,5.901,6.4,10,4,Oh I'm just
2,14.67,19.08,10,3,Oh okay.
3,7.37,7.65,10,3,Sorry.
4,15.38,15.66,10,4,Okay.  
5,16.12,18.92,10,4,The test that you are completing today is called the weights test.
6,19.67,23.17,10,4,In part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorful cubes.
7,24.01,26.75,10,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams.
8,27.57,30.84,10,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here.
9,31.53,42.59,10,4,All of the weights are intervals of ten grams so you don't need to use the slider um and the scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop you can assume the weights are fairly equal
10,43.52,51.002,10,4,You must place the cubes onto this worksheet once you have determined their weight and also enter their weight in the survey on the computer.
11,51.75,53.32,10,4,Uh you can now start the survey.
12,53.33,54.58,10,4,You guys are gonna be group number ten.
13,55.33,57.08,10,3,Okay so the red is ten grams?
14,57.33,57.4,10,2,Yeah.
15,57.59,58.32,10,3,Okay.  
16,58.47,59.92,10,1,So I suppose like
17,60.67,65.67,10,1,Let's assume that the bigger ones are 
18,66.58,67.42,10,2,Let's put two yeah.
19,68.25,69.5,10,1,We can put that other one here too.
20,69.25,70,10,2,Red one as well.
21,71.73,72.25,10,3,Hmmm.
22,74,74.98,10,2,Too hard a selection.
23,78.08,79.06,10,1,Yeah I suppose.
24,79.58,82.08,10,3,I guess this is like twenty and this is like ten and ten.
25,82.33,82.84,10,2,Hopefully.
26,82.97,85.59,10,3,I mean what why didn't we first check out whether these two are equal.
27,85.41,86.17,10,1,Yeah.
28,85.91,87.91,10,3,They are of equal size but
29,87.41,88.16,10,2,They're the same.
30,88.41,90.17,10,2,Uhhhh just don't want to touch it.
31,96.5,98,10,3,It looks like they're fairly equal.
32,100,101.08,10,2,Yeah I suppose.
33,100.84,102.85,10,3,Right so then that's twenty these two are ten.
34,104.33,105.32,10,2,Let's see.
35,104.59,106.59,10,1,That would make sense to me.
36,108.83,110.92,10,2,Just a sec let it settle for the
37,111.42,111.62,10,3,Mmhmm
38,115.17,115.92,10,3,Hmmm.
39,117.42,119.17,10,3,Looks fairly equal to me yeah.
40,117.46,118.87,10,2,Yeah they're together.
41,119.75,120,10,3,Alright.
42,119.75,120.68,10,2,Yeah they're they're equal.
43,121.5,124.25,10,3,Well now let's do these two.
44,123,123.75,10,1,You can just
45,125.34,128.25,10,3,I can already tell this one's heavier yeah.
46,127,127.23,10,2,Heavier.
47,128.58,129.84,10,2,So let's put the ten one ten.
48,130.33,131.08,10,2,Let's put one ten.
49,132.58,133.08,10,2,Let's see.
50,136.34,138.42,10,1,I say they are equal.
51,138.43,139.92,10,2,Yeah fairly equal but let's see.
52,140.64,142.91,10,1,Those are the instructions I suppose
53,142.92,144.13,10,3,We gotta be.
54,145.5,146,10,3,Oh.
55,146.28,150.25,10,3,Try this one out as well like after some time wait wait wait let's let's see if it balances.
56,149.75,150.11,10,2,Yeah.
57,151.46,153,10,3,Cause I have a feeling this is a little more.
58,157.81,163.33,10,1,I'm not sure was uh just a bit more like we would be able to tell the difference.
59,161.42,163.39,10,2,Just a second just a sec
60,166.41,167.67,10,3,Like you would be able to see it right?
61,167.39,168,10,2,Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
62,169.16,170,10,2,Just a sec.
63,171.5,173.26,10,2,Stop now please.
64,180.78,183.35,10,2,I'm guessing it's a little bit to the left a little bit to the left like
65,184.06,184.67,10,3,Yeah.
66,184.9,187.4,10,2,It touches the red line but on the left hand side of the left line red
67,187.42,190.4,10,3,so let's try to put that on top and see
68,190.41,191.17,10,2,it's gonna be heavier
69,191.38,194.73,10,3,Okay so it's definitely not like fourty.
70,193.56,195.68,10,2,Like not equal but almost almost equal
71,195,197.46,10,3,Like thirty two thirty three what do you say.
72,197.75,199.21,10,3,Cause this one's twenty this one's ten
73,199,201.26,10,2,How do wait how do we know this one's twenty did we
74,201.25,202.21,10,3,Cause we did it.
75,202.32,202.56,10,2,no we didn't
76,203.33,207.27,10,2,We we moved it and checked the two tens remember we didn't do this one.
77,207.46,209.92,10,3,Yeah but then when we have the two yeah.
78,208.39,212.15,10,1,To begin with also like we don't really have time to do this.
79,211.4,211.92,10,3,Yeah.
80,212.12,214.91,10,2,Okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty
81,213.14,217,10,3,yeah so I would say around thirty two or something.
82,216.15,216.41,10,2,Thirty yeah
83,217.89,219.78,10,2,Thirty one thirty two so thirty
84,218.23,219,10,3,So okay.
85,220,220.5,10,3,Cool.
86,223,225,10,1,Um you know what let's try this.
87,224.72,225.48,10,3,What's left.
88,228.21,228.74,10,3,Okay.  
89,234.11,235.39,10,1,Do these make sense
90,247.61,250.52,10,2,So this one's thirty and what's this one twenty right
91,250.73,250.83,10,1,Twenty.
92,250.75,251.5,10,3,Twenty Yeah.
93,251.78,254.24,10,2,Twenty okay so this one's gonna be fifty okay.
94,260.9,262.41,10,2,Almost there.
95,263.83,266.14,10,3,I mean it's not gonna go anywhere I guess it's just
96,265.91,269.13,10,2,It's more tilting to the right so less than fifty
97,268.15,268.91,10,3,Oh.
98,270,270.72,10,3,Okay
99,270,274,10,2,But there's no like I mean between weights so fifty.
100,274.24,275.81,10,1,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere
101,278.32,280.07,10,2,Just a sec let this settle now.
102,280.08,283.33,10,3,This is gonna be too heavy I think this is around yeah.
103,280.81,281.31,10,2,Yeah.
104,283.84,286.57,10,2,This is like less than fifty less than fifty.
105,284.97,285.4,10,3,Fifty
106,286.92,289.89,10,3,Like if those are more than fifty then this is less
107,289.78,290.41,10,2,Less than fifty
108,290.45,290.71,10,3,Yeah.
109,295.5,297.25,10,3,I guess we're done huh.
110,297.14,297.73,10,1,Makes sense if
111,298.25,301.5,10,3,I just want to feel it though I really want to see if it's the heaviest
112,302.51,302.78,10,3,Should I
113,303,305,10,2,Yeah yeah it's it's almost settled down so it's less than fifty
114,305.08,307.26,10,3,Oh yeah this is fifty grams 
115,307.81,308.83,10,1,So this was thirty right
116,309.17,309.33,10,2,Yeah.
117,309.31,312.48,10,1,Thirty this was twenty and these are tens
118,309.91,310.17,10,3,Okay.  
119,310.13,310.42,10,2,Twenty
120,312.89,313.67,10,2,and that's fifty
121,313.87,314.17,10,3,Fifty
122,316.91,317.36,10,2,tens yeah
123,318.23,319.14,10,2,So that's it
124,320.47,320.71,10,2,Hopefully
125,320.63,322,10,3,Well we have more weights here
126,322.72,324,10,3,Like one fourty
127,323.25,324.18,10,1,This mandate
128,325,326,10,3,But no blocks
129,327.82,329.84,10,1,What are we supposed to do we are supposed do
130,329.82,331.59,10,3,Do you have more blocks or I think we're done here.
131,331.53,333.09,10,1,We are supposed to enter it in the laptop
132,333.33,334.59,10,3,Oh okay let's do that
133,335.64,336.41,10,2,Ten I guess
134,335.87,337.17,10,3,Group number ten
135,342.68,342.98,10,3,okay
136,343.5,345,10,2,So the yellow one's fifty
137,344,344.67,10,3,Now help me out
138,344.52,345,10,1,Fifty
139,345.92,346.17,10,3,Fifty
140,346.41,346.58,10,1,Yeah
141,346.92,347.12,10,2,Yeah
142,347.21,349,10,3,Okay green
143,348.23,350.5,10,2,Green wait green's twenty
144,350.25,350.68,10,1,Twenty
145,352.82,353.23,10,3,Okay
146,353.34,355.84,10,1,And they’re two blue
147,355.32,359.09,10,2,Tens tens are blue blue and red yup
148,359.57,362.12,10,3,blue and reds well they don't have the right uh purple
149,361.92,363.41,10,2,Purple's this one thirty
150,363.57,365.67,10,3,Thirty right yeah alright let's do it
151,366.42,373.25,10,1,you know what like I feel that is this what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right 
152,373.75,376.35,10,3,No I think this is this is the one which is purple
153,374,375.5,10,2,No no no no
154,376.25,383.09,10,2,So like they gave the weight of this one they gave the weight of the red one so that's why they didn't include this one they already gave us yeah
155,376.5,378.5,10,1,There are four options so
156,381.83,382.59,10,3,Oh.
157,383.74,386.09,10,3,lets go ahead and hit this.
158,387.42,390.67,10,3,red is ten grams  yellow is fifty grams 
159,388.42,389.17,10,2,Yeah red ten given
160,391.12,396.25,10,3,Green is twenty I mean we're we're right right I mean we're exactly right
161,394.25,397,10,2,Uh yeah let's see
162,398.25,401.25,10,3,No the red is ten blue is ten yellow is fifty
163,399.5,402.33,10,2,Yeah yeah yeah we're we're right
164,402.57,403.09,10,3,Okay.  
165,405.01,406.09,10,2,Where is the mystery block
166,406.84,407.59,10,2,Any idea
167,407.84,409.84,10,3,Indicate the weight of the mystery block
168,410.18,411.04,10,1,You have two attempts
169,411.17,411.42,10,2,Okay
170,411.67,411.95,10,3,Whoa
171,412.17,413.12,10,2,okay we remove the scale
172,414.67,416.42,10,4,Determine the weight of this mystery block 
173,416.42,417.67,10,3,Where is the blue guy
174,416.87,418.67,10,1,It's heavier than everything else
175,419.67,424.5,10,4,Um you guys will have two attempts to enter the data correctly into the survey
176,422,422.75,10,2,Two attempts okay
177,424.5,426,10,2,Wait this one is what again fifty
178,426.08,426.59,10,3,This is fifty
179,426.84,427.84,10,2,This is this is
180,428.82,430.07,10,3,That's that was thirty
181,429.34,430.58,10,1,Thirty Twenty
182,430.59,431.57,10,2,Okay just a sec
183,433.32,438.67,10,2,Can we form something on one side like this place the other one
184,439.15,440.63,10,3,Well just just try to get a feel of It.
185,441.42,443.42,10,2,So okay yeah
186,445.5,449.5,10,1,I would say still heavier than all these blocks
187,447.5,449.25,10,2,Okay really
188,449.5,449.75,10,3,Really
189,450,451.75,10,1,Yeah can you grab there and hold it
190,450.25,450.84,10,2,Really
191,455.32,456.02,10,2,Just a sec
192,457.59,460.34,10,2,So the yellow one's fifty
193,460.84,462.58,10,2,thirty twenty ten ten okay
194,463.42,463.67,10,2,Just a sec
195,465.42,466.42,10,3,Almost the same.
196,468.37,469.5,10,3,Fifty thirty twenty
197,470.5,471.42,10,3,hundred and ten
198,472.25,474.67,10,3,like a hundred or a hundred and ten that would be my guess.
199,473.25,475,10,2,Suppose I remove the tens ones then
200,475.5,478.03,10,1,Fifty thirty eighty twenty hundred
201,478.57,479.31,10,2,how are you
202,478.68,479.85,10,3,This is hard to say
203,480.09,482.34,10,2,how are you really holding I'm just moving blocks and seeing
204,482.31,484.07,10,1,so like one thirty or one fourty
205,483.34,486.02,10,2,Yeah this is lighter this is lighter
206,487.67,488.62,10,2,If I put the ten
207,491.17,491.91,10,2,Still lighter
208,492.13,492.58,10,1,Yeah
209,497.23,499,10,2,Comparatively less lighter but
210,499.5,500,10,2,Same
211,502,502.5,10,1,Umm
212,502.75,503.25,10,3,Let me try
213,503.75,505.56,10,1,Do you want to try like one thirty
214,505.06,507.54,10,2,Like like wait let's remove these two let's check
215,507.87,509.53,10,2,This one is lighter right on the right side
216,510.91,511.41,10,2,How's your read
217,512.89,517.92,10,3,It's hard it really it's hard to say because it depends on how strong your hands are both hands so
218,519.25,524,10,3,I don't know like ninety or maybe a hundred you know it could be is my guess.
219,523,525.75,10,2,How much is it so we have fifty thirty eighty
220,525.25,526.25,10,3,We have a hundred and ten
221,526.5,528,10,2,ten hundred hundred and twenty
222,528.5,529.33,10,2,Because two tens
223,529.58,530.57,10,3,Oh we have two okay
224,530.25,531.33,10,2,Two tens there's two
225,531.56,531.84,10,3,Okay
226,532.05,535.07,10,2,so the thing is like if we put this also feels lighter right
227,536.56,538.84,10,1,Yeah uh maybe not
228,539.14,539.67,10,2,Maybe not
229,540.13,541.42,10,1,Difficult it is um
230,541.57,542.64,10,2,Just a sec okay
231,545.42,546.91,10,2,Yeah it's lighter but this
232,549.9,550.67,10,2,Almost same
233,551,551.5,10,3,Okay
234,551.75,552.75,10,2,let's let's do it
235,552.5,555.25,10,1,This is um this whole block is one twenty right so
236,555.58,556.08,10,2,Yeah 
237,556.28,556.83,10,1,Where do we wanna
238,556.85,561.58,10,3,I think one twenty and one ten would be a good idea because we have two chances
239,561.81,562.08,10,1,Yeah
240,562.39,562.67,10,3,Right
241,563.42,569.37,10,1,I I was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but that also makes sense because I don't know any better.
242,565.62,566.14,10,3,Oh.
243,568.41,568.75,10,3,okay.
244,571.75,572.5,10,2,see this
245,575,577.25,10,2,This feels same almost try it
246,577,578,10,3,Oh let's try it out
247,581,589.17,10,1,It's strange that like you are saying that all of these stacked up were all identical to that and now these 
248,585.84,586.41,10,2,No no no no
249,586.17,587.67,10,3,Hundred and ten so that's like a hundred
250,589.42,596.25,10,2,No no no no so the thing is like when you put this it feels almost same because it's just ten gram difference that's why
251,596.5,598.25,10,3,So that that would put it at like a hundred
252,598.25,599,10,2,Let let's try it
253,599.3,603.02,10,3,Because that one would be a hundred and ten and this is a hundred ten so that's hundred
254,601.25,601.34,10,2,Yeah
255,601.75,604.25,10,1,I mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess
256,606,609.75,10,2,fifty thirty eighty hundred hundred and ten over there
257,610.81,613.78,10,2,hundred and ten yeah let's put hundred and ten let's see what happens
258,614.67,616.41,10,3,Well If we're going to put a hundred and ten
259,615.14,617.42,10,2,No wait wait this is hundred this is hundred this is hundred
260,617.67,619.87,10,2,So means hundred and ten is total this
261,617.69,617.92,10,3,What
262,619.63,625.75,10,3,No that's what I said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first I think we should go with a hundred and ten first
263,622.83,623.15,10,2,Yeah
264,626.25,626.43,10,1,Yeah
265,626.5,627.57,10,2,Okay yeah sure sure sure
266,626.56,629.34,10,3,Then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right
267,630.31,631.24,10,2,Sure let's see
268,635.04,637.63,10,3,Okay this is okay
269,637.65,638.42,10,2,The brain is
270,640.89,641.86,10,3,Okay this is not quite correct
271,642.92,646,10,1,weights of the prior blocks and use it oh okay
272,646.75,649.75,10,1,So these are ten ten twenty
273,647.18,647.5,10,2,Prior blocks
274,649.72,651.34,10,3,So between the weights of the prior blocks
275,650.5,650.75,10,1,Thirty
276,652.5,655,10,1,Fifty it's Fibonacci or something right
277,655.31,655.84,10,3,Wait wait what's 
278,655.82,657.56,10,1,One one two three five
279,656.81,659.14,10,3,Two three five eight thirteen twenty
280,659.09,661.34,10,1,Wait eight eighty maybe
281,661.08,663.89,10,2,ten ten thirty fifty 
282,663.61,663.92,10,3,Eighty
283,665.12,666.42,10,3,Yeah that's Fibonacci definitely
284,666.67,666.91,10,1,Yeah
285,667.63,669.41,10,1,Ah I mean that's
286,668.13,677.25,10,2,Ten ten this is what twenty right one plus one two yup two plus one three yup three plus two five oh yeah that's fifty
287,677.75,680.25,10,2,and five plus three eight yeah let's go for eighty then
288,681.34,683.55,10,3,Like just because of just becasuse that's Fibonacci
289,684.32,685.81,10,2,That's a pattern that's it
290,686.39,688.16,10,1,Like maybe we can find a pattern
291,688.37,692.64,10,3,Because I'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means
292,692.91,693.25,10,2,Yeah it's
293,693.27,696.5,10,3,Is that the pattern or is that you know just use those weights
294,695.67,699,10,2,is is there any other series I'm not missing out I mean ten
295,699.67,702.5,10,1,I'm not sure how far we can get by using the weight
296,700.25,700.75,10,2,Twenty
297,701.25,701.36,10,3,Right
298,701.75,703,10,3,That that is true anyway
299,702.72,703,10,2,Thirty
300,703.28,704,10,2,Fifty
301,703.75,705.56,10,3,And also I mean
302,706.5,709.5,10,3,We don't really have to be correct I mean we're trying to be correct but
303,711.02,714.87,10,3,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty
304,715.17,719.5,10,1,Yeah but also like I can't judge anything by just holding things
305,719.75,722,10,3,Well let's try to see if there is a hint here
306,722.25,723.5,10,3,This is eight RB
307,724.25,726,10,3,I think that that is eighty
308,726.75,727,10,3,I don't know what what's
309,727,728.5,10,1,This is nine RB so
310,730,731.5,10,3,Oh no they don't have any hints here
311,732.81,735.82,10,3,Eighty gram sounds seems like a ninety gram to me but
312,737.02,738.42,10,3,It's cool we have to I guess
313,738.57,739.92,10,2,Eighty let's let's go for eighty
314,739.86,741.65,10,3,Eighty alright
315,740.29,740.67,10,2,Yeah
316,741.89,743.91,10,3,I would go for ninety but you guys are going for eighty
317,744.42,745.15,10,3,Alright.
318,745.41,746.67,10,1,I would have gone for one thirty
319,747.5,748.5,10,2,Eighty there you go
320,749.25,749.5,10,2,Yeah
321,749.68,750.25,10,3,Cool
322,752.25,752.5,10,3,Okay
323,753,758,10,4,For the final part of this test read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block
324,758.06,758.34,10,2,What's this
325,758.35,762.31,10,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
326,765.12,766.67,10,1,Can you read it out loud or something
327,766.92,771.42,10,3,Well the factory that creates the wooden blocks did not send us the second mystery block 
328,770.9,771.41,10,2,Okay
329,771.68,778.5,10,3,You have two opportunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one two sentences how you determined your estimate
330,779.34,780.09,10,3,Indicate the weight of the second mystery block
331,781.87,783.31,10,1,Fibonacci like let's say
332,784.03,784.32,10,2,Eight
333,784.47,786.52,10,3,Is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block
334,786.54,787.51,10,2,That's the first one
335,787.65,790.41,10,1,That's the first one according to our translate
336,789.42,791.39,10,2,So eight plus five
337,792.41,792.67,10,1,Thirteen one thirty
338,792.62,793.17,10,2,Thirteen
339,793.42,794.38,10,2,Yeah there is one thirty
340,795.14,795.67,10,2,Eight plus five
341,796.75,797.25,10,2,Just do it
342,798.25,799.47,10,3,Wait wait wait a second
343,800.5,801.71,10,3,So that was the first mystery block
344,801.74,801.77,10,2,Yeah
345,802.31,803.34,10,3,and we already did that
346,803.38,803.52,10,2,Yeah
347,803.83,804.53,10,3,Now this is
348,804.5,805.25,10,2,The second one
349,805.5,807.75,10,2,Means according to that statement is the second one
350,808,809.5,10,3,Yeah oh okay okay okay okay
351,809.32,809.83,10,2,Mystery block two
352,810.02,810.31,10,3,Right
353,811.04,812.52,10,2,So eight plus five one thirty
354,814.08,816.56,10,1,Makes sense to me as much sense as I can make of it
355,816.17,816.42,10,2,Yeah
356,817.15,817.42,10,3,Okay
357,817.91,819.15,10,2,One thirty that's it
358,821.25,822.75,10,2,Follows Fibonacci series that's it
359,824.75,825.75,10,1,Follow Fibonacci
360,826,826.5,10,3,Explain one
361,826.75,827.26,10,1,Please explain one
362,827.75,828.5,10,2,Yeah follows Fibonacci
363,836.15,837.92,10,3,mmm
364,854.83,855.32,10,2,And it works
365,857.83,859.07,10,2,And it works that's it
366,860.57,862.32,10,3,Second is one thirty right
367,863.21,864.34,10,1,eighty plus fifty is
368,864.24,866.17,10,2,Yeah one one one thirty one thirty
369,864.27,867.67,10,3,Yeah it's one thirty it is I know that hang on a second one thirty
370,868.91,871.41,10,1,Don't want to be incorrect in addition
371,876.5,877,10,3,Okay
372,881.02,882.08,10,2,Yeah so we got it right
373,882.58,884.21,10,2,Do not for fall but please identify
374,884.57,884.84,10,3,Okay
375,884.92,886.09,10,2,Yay we completed it
376,887.06,888.92,10,3,So yeah Fibonacci is what it is
377,889.02,889.17,10,2,Yeah
378,890.41,892.17,10,3,Well they should ask this in GREs
