1,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams,red != 10,0.031809542,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
2,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams,red > 10,0.032191157,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
3,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams,red < 10,0.03088932,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
4,ok well red block would be nine minus ten,red = 10,0.97270954,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
5,ok well red block would be nine minus ten,red != 10,0.060729843,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
6,ok well red block would be nine minus ten,red > 10,0.038129583,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
