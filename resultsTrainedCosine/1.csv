1,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams,red != 10,0.29255474,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
2,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams,red > 10,0.015977662,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
3,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams,red < 10,0.013625518,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
4,ok well red block would be nine minus ten,red = 10,0.99911726,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
5,ok well red block would be nine minus ten,red != 10,0.61109495,<m> red = 10 </m>,1
